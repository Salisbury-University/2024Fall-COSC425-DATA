AR BFR cuffs adjust pressure as the muscle undergoes concentric and eccentric contractions, maintaining a constant pressure in the limb throughout the entire range of motion. NAR BFR training cuffs do not adjust pressure throughout the range of motion thus causing greater pressures in the limb during concentric contraction when the muscle size is enlarged. How this exercise acutely impacts arterial stiffness in upper body exercise is not well understood.\nMETHODS: Following a randomized familiarization period with AR or NAR BFR biceps curl exercise, 33 adults (20 \u00b1 2 years; 11 females) participated in 3 randomized sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no-BFR (no cuffs) separated by 1-week washout periods. Using 20% of the 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) with 2-second concentric/eccentric cadence, participants performed 4 sets of biceps curls to failure. Training limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both BFR sessions. Measurements before and immediately following the training session included blood pressure acquisition, arterial tonometry, and ultrasonography of the carotid artery. Between and within effects of treatment on central systolic blood pressure (cSBP), central diastolic BP (cDBP), central pulse pressure (cPP), central mean arterial pressure (cMAP), pulse wave velocity (PWV), beta-stiffness index (\u03b2-stiff), and arterial compliance (AC) were analyzed with two-way ANOVAs.\nRESULTS: There were no baseline differences in variable of interest (all p > 0.05). cDBP increased posted exercise in all three groups (AR-BFR mean difference (MD) = 7 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01; NAR-BFR MD = 6 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01; no BFR MD = 5 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01). And there was a non-significant trend in \u03b2-stiff (MD = 1.25 \u00b1 0.46 au, p = 0.07) and AC (MD = -0.3 \u00b1 0.1 mm2/mmHg x 10-1, p = 0.07) with the no BFR treatment.\nCONCLUSION: The present findings show acute AR-BFR and NAR-BFR bicep training did not impact arterial stiffness.

AR-BFR pressure cuffs adjust pressure automatically, maintaining a similar pressure during concentric and eccentric phases. However, NAR-BFR pressure cuffs do not accommodate for larger muscle diameters during the concentric phase, creating higher limb pressures compared to the eccentric phase.\nMETHODS: Accordingly, 33 adults (21 \u00b1 2 years; 11 females) participated in the upper body and 20 adults (23 \u00b1 5 years; 7 females) participated in the lower body in treatment-order exercise sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no BFR in a randomized fashion separated by 1-week and included a familiarization session. All participants in the upper body sessions performed four sets of dumbbell curls and all participants in the lower body sessions performed four sets of wall squats with handheld dumbbells to volitional fatigue using 20% of their 1-RM with 2-second cadence and 1 minute rest periods. Cuffs were placed at the proximal portion of the arms and thighs, and limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both BFR treatments during the exercise and rest periods for both the upper and lower body sessions, respectively. Subjective measurements of RPE, RPD, and the 1-10 Likert scale were taken immediately post-exercise while the cuffs were inflated. Two-way ANOVAs were conducted on variables of interest.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in RPE between AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no BFR in the upper and lower body sessions (p = 0.13). There was a significant difference in RDP between upper body AR-BFR and no BFR (mean difference (MD) = 2.23 \u00b1 0.47, p < 0.01) and upper body NAR-BFR and no BFR (mean difference (MD) = 1.32 \u00b1 0.47, p = 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: The use of BFR does not appear to influence subjective ratings of exertion in the upper and lower limbs. Additionally, AR-BFR and NAR-BFR devices may cause more subjective discomfort compared to no BFR.\n",

        "abstract": "Predation can lead to nonlethal injury as well as mortality in turtles, with many Clemmys guttata (Spotted Turtle) having predator-induced limb and foot amputations. The impact of such injuries on movements of freshwater turtles remains poorly understood. We tracked Spotted Turtles (n = 20) in a single population on the Delmarva Peninsula using radio telemetry for \u223c1 year. Seven turtles had at least 1 limb or foot completely amputated by a predator, and the remaining 13 were uninjured. When comparing movements among turtles, we found no difference in home-range sizes between male (n = 8) and female (n = 7) nor between injured (n = 7) and uninjured (n = 8) Spotted Turtles during their breeding season. However, injured turtles (n = 5) had smaller home ranges (mean \u00b1 SE = 0.26 \u00b1 0.14 ha) than uninjured turtles (n = 12, 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 ha) during the nonbreeding season, when turtles are more terrestrial. Our findings suggest a potential ecological cost of nonlethal injury, as predator effects might extend beyond simple mortality.\n\nNortheastern Naturalist publishes natural history research related to the biology and ecology of the organisms and environments of northeastern North America.\n\nRegistered users receive a variety of benefits including the ability to customize email alerts, create favorite journals list, and save searches.

        "abstract": "## Problem:\nThe Eastern Shore of Maryland is a beautiful region that boasts a multicultural community of 455,000 year-round residents. Despite its rural location, the coastal lifestyle attracts retirees, making it the state\u2019s oldest population. Unfortunately, the region also has the highest socioeconomic disparities in the state, which creates difficulties in accessing healthcare. This is a significant public health issue that results in costly barriers to preventive care and timely, accounting for $320 billion in unnecessary healthcare spending.\n\n## Description of the problem:\nMaryland\u2019s healthcare funding formulas favor larger health systems in urban areas, leading to health inequities. To address this, we propose an innovative scenario analysis model partially based on European public health approaches. This model will adjust funding formulas based on each region\u2019s specific needs and challenges, promoting fairness and equity in healthcare funding.\n\n## Results:\nAdopting this population health management approach would have built-in efficiencies: In the United States, healthcare spending tends to be higher among underserved populations due to delayed care, access challenges, missed diagnoses, and limited access to the latest scientific advances as well as proper preventive services.\n\n## Lessons:\nThe proposed scenario-based public health funding approach targeting the needs of the underserved population on the Eastern Shore of Maryland could yield significant positive health outcomes and health savings generating a ripple effect across the state, and perhaps even the country. The lessons learned in how other countries handle public health funding could lead to global collaboration.\n\n## Key messages:\n\u2022\u2002Our approach aims to provide a practical solution to unnecessary healthcare spending.\n\n\u2022\u2002We must adapt to the changing tides to stay on course.\n",

We examined rape victim empathy based on type of rape experience (none, incapacitated, forcible, combined). Undergraduate women ( n\u2009=\u2009658) completed the Rape Victim Empathy-During Subscale and Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization. Rape experience was associated with greater empathy, especially for those with any forcible experience. Perhaps due to weaker memory of their own rape event, incapacitated victims may be relatively less able than forcible victims to understand another victim's perspective during a rape. Researchers should consider examining incapacitated and forcible rape as distinct experiences.\n",

Five domains (challenges, identity, values, relationship, and well-being) and seventeen categories emerged. Participants experienced implicit discrimination and cultural barriers. They identified themselves as Koreans and valued family\u2019s well-being as their priority. They made efforts to find meaning and satisfaction by supporting children to become independent adults. Participants were aware of their traditional parenting styles and the intergenerational cultural gap with their children. As first-generation immigrants, Korean immigrant fathers reported a lack of genuine relationships with both Korean Americans and non-Korean Americans outside of their families. Although participants reported freedom from the pressure caused by interdependent Korean culture, they felt homesickness and emptiness without their own valued life goals.\n",

For the experiment, students prepare a solution of a series of homologous analytes and collect mass spectra of those analytes using GC-MS. All the analytes undergo the same three-step fragmentation in the mass spectrometer. The relative peak intensities from the ions in the fragmentation scheme are plotted as a function of the vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecular ions\u2019 R group. Trends in these plots can be explained using concepts from RRK theory and highlight the \u201cdegrees of freedom effect\u201d in mass spectrometry. The experiment is suitable for a variety of upper-level, undergraduate chemistry laboratories.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT To investigate the acute effects of 4 sets of autoregulated (AR-BFR) versus non-autoregulated (NAR-BFR) applied pressures during blood flow restriction (BFR) resistance exercise to volitional failure compared with low-load exercise without BFR. A randomized crossover design study was conducted on 32 healthy adults (20.8 \u00b1 2.3 years; 11 females). Outcome measures were as follows: (1) arterial stiffness, (2) peak perceptual responses and likelihood to perform again, and (3) performance. Results: Post-exercise changes in central and brachial diastolic blood pressure were decreased in all groups. Post-exercise supine systolic blood pressure in no-BFR increased (mean difference (MD) = -4 \u00b1 1 mmHg, 95% CI (1\u20137), p = 0.003, \u03b72 = 0.13). Total repetitions performed and volume workload were similar between BFR conditions but less than no-BFR. AR-BFR reported significantly higher exertion (MD = -0.53 \u00b1 0.2, 95% CI (0.04\u20131.0), p = 0.03, \u03b72 = 0.19) than other conditions, and induced greater discomfort (MD = -2.50 \u00b1 0.36, 95% CI (1.63\u20133.37), p < 0.001, \u03b72 = 0.28) than no-BFR. Conclusion: Biceps curl exercise to volitional failure appears to induce negligible arterial stiffness or blood pressure changes regardless of the application of autoregulation, yet autoregulation appears to enhance the perceptual response to BFR exercise compared to NAR-BFR without impacting exercise performance. KEYWORDS: BFR therapy, central stiffness, pulse wave velocity. Acknowledgments: We wish to thank Delfi Medical for loaning the devices used within this study for research purposes.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The importance of employee-owned (EO) organizations around the world is increasing. Countries, communities and organizations are realizing that passing profits to workers increases wealth at all levels of society. The benefits, widely known, include personal prosperity, organizational profitability and stability, and a host of economic benefits for communities in which EO companies operate. Selling a company to employees, or starting a cooperative organization containing worker owners, is not without risk. New skills are required for the company to reap the rewards inherent in EO organizations, but the method of creating this change varies significantly from one organization to another. Each is unique, but there are some factors that are common to most EO organizations that have achieved a dynamic organizational culture. These factors, which are critical for success, can be isolated using structured research, organized through a lens of general systems theory and operationalized using principles of Learning Management (LM). The result is an organized knowledge transfer plan that maximizes resources and provides the highest probability of a successful transition to a uniquely profitable EO company. KEYWORDS: Employee ownership, knowledge transfer, learning management, critical success factors, engagement culture JEL CLASSIFICATION: O43\n\n1. Overview Research indicates that extraordinarily successful employee-owned (EO) organizations have a culture that supports everyday employee engagement (Berry and Fitz-Gerald Citation 2018), making a unique contribution to the prosperity of the organization. Why this occurs is the subject of ongoing research designed to discover what factors contribute to employee-ownership principles, and result in increases in revenues and profitability. Literature containing information on high-performing work systems (HPWS) seems to lay a foundation for EO practices (Calo and Shipper, Citation 2018), but the commitment, and ownership mentality occurs in highly successful organizations that are owned by employees in trusts, cooperative agreements, or through equity arrangements. The results of EO are well documented and include organizations outperforming competitors in a variety of areas (Kruse Citation 2022), attracting and maintaining top talent (Kurland Citation 2018), increases in innovation and efficiency (Agafitei and Avasilcai Citation 2015), and resilience during economic downturns. For employee-owners, the benefits are also substantial and include job satisfaction and security (Uzuriaga, 2028), increased motivation (Blasi et al. Citation 2008), and of course the financial rewards that come from owning equity in the organization, among others. One of the largest benefits of EO, however, may be the economic benefits seen by communities when workers become owners (Inserra, Conway, and Rodat Citation 2002). Jobs are preserved and increased in local communities (J. R. Blasi, Freeman, and Kruse Citation 2013), and stability is improved with the longer-term outlook of EO organizations. EO companies also tend to have a reciprocal commitment to the communities in which they reside, contributing to an upward spiral of growth and economic prosperity. Some scholars note that EO organizations have higher levels of commitment to the environment, locally and beyond, and often engage in practices that are ecologically and socially sustainable. None of these benefits are realized merely because of transferring ownership to employees. They become a reality when employees begin to think like owners \u2013 at all levels of the organization. The first portion of this paper is dedicated to the factors that create this unique culture within EO organizations, and the latter is devoted to operationalizing \u2013 actually transforming \u2013 workers into owners. This paper delivers a set of critical success factors (CSFs) of employee ownership as discovered in approximately 100 carefully curated articles, cases, and books dedicated to the subject of employee engagement in EO organizations. CSF research is appropriate because it is designed to produce a set of factors that must receive top priority during a high-stakes implementation (Ram and Corkindale Citation 2014), and if they are neglected, the likelihood of success decreases significantly. CSF is used to manage enterprise-wide change initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions, complex software implementations and other major projects (Trkman Citation 2010). Becoming employee-owned requires a level of business acumen that needs to be supported by research, which must be translated into activities that will contribute directly to the success of the firm. Using the methods outlined in the next section, a metasynthesis was undertaken that yielded CSFs and their context, as reported by dozens of successful organizations. The broad CSFs discovered in the literature are as follows: Accountability/Responsibility, Communication, Governance, Innovation, Leadership, Working in Teams, Training, Transparency (Especially in Finance). There were other CSFs identified in the literature that were shown to be a result of attending to other CSFs over time. This paper was developed to explain the process of implementing employee ownership, and the below are outcomes. Culture \u2013 Values, Engagement, HR Practices, Recruiting, Selection, Onboarding, Training and Development, Rewards and Recognition, Retention.\n",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study is to determine if extended\u2010release, bioabsorbable, subcutaneous naltrexone (NTX) implants can mitigate respiratory depression after an intravenous injection (IV) of fentanyl. Six different BIOabsorbable Polymeric Implant Naltrexone (BIOPIN) formulations, comprising combinations of Poly\u2010d,l\u2010Lactic Acid (PDLLA) and/or Polycaprolactone (PCL\u20101 or PCL\u20102), were used to create subcutaneous implants. Both placebo and naltrexone implants were implanted subcutaneously in male dogs. The active naltrexone implants consisted of two doses, 644\u2009mg and 1288\u2009mg. A challenge with IV fentanyl was performed in 33 male dogs at 97\u2013100\u2009days after implantation. Following the administration of a 30\u2009\u03bcg/kg intravenous fentanyl dose, the placebo cohort manifested a swift and profound respiratory depression with a ~50% reduction in their pre\u2010dose respiratory rate (RR). The BIOPIN NTX\u2010implanted dogs were exposed to escalating doses of intravenous fentanyl (30\u2009\u03bcg/kg, 60\u2009\u03bcg/kg, 90\u2009\u03bcg/kg, and 120\u2009\u03bcg/kg). In contrast, the dogs implanted with the BIOPIN naltrexone implants tolerated doses up to 60\u2009\u03bcg/kg without significant respiratory depression (<50%) but had severe respiratory depression with fentanyl doses of 90\u2009\u03bcg/kg and especially at 120\u2009\u03bcg/kg. Bioabsorbable, extended\u2010release BIOPIN naltrexone implants are effective in mitigating fentanyl\u2010induced respiratory depression in male canines at about 3\u2009months after implantation. This technology may also have potential for mitigating fentanyl\u2010induced respiratory depression in humans.\n",

In addition, sociodemographic and environmental factors impact exercise motivation and physical activity; yet, only limited research has compared motivations and behaviors between different student groups. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare exercise motivation and physical activity among college students. In this quantitative cross-sectional survey study, a volunteer sample of 307 undergraduate students (75.2% White, 68.7% Female) enrolled in health and fitness courses at a Mid-Atlantic region United States University and Community College completed an online demographic questionnaire, International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), and Behavioral Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-3). A series of independent samples t-tests were conducted to compare relative autonomy index (RAI) and subscale scores (obtained via the BREQ-3), as well as physical activity scores (MET-minutes/week obtained via the IPAQ-SF). Statistically significant differences in exercise motivation and physical activity were found based on student age, housing status, major/program of study, and gender identity. In an effort to reduce health disparities, university administrators and coordinators are advised to keep these considerations in mind when developing physical activity policies and programs for college students.\n\nKEYWORDS: Physical activity, exercise motivation, college students\n\nDisclosure statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n",

The defection of the Karuna Group from Sri Lanka\u2019s LTTE during the 2002\u20132006 peace process served as the case study to investigate this research question. The disagreement between LTTE leader Prabhakaran and Karuna was the immediate cause of the split. The negotiation disagreement stemmed from the decision to explore federalism as a solution to the conflict. There were supporting factors that boosted the negotiation disagreement. Karuna\u2019s pro-peace transformation, his insecurities, the differences between the Northern and Eastern Tamils, and the external influence enhanced and consolidated the negotiation disagreement.\n\nGraphical Abstract\nDisplay full size\n\nKEYWORDS: Civil war, peace negotiation, rebel fragmentation, Sri Lanka, LTTE\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nNotes\n1.

While there are different types of exchange rate risk, this study focuses specifically on the ongoing exposure of cash flow transactions denominated in the currencies of seven different developed countries. Since other types of risk (i.e., economic and translation) are evaluated based on yearly results, they are not considered in this study. Themodifiedvalue-at-risk (MVaR) model is employed to estimate the maximum one-period losses during the eighteen months before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and, in addition, the maximum one-period losses during the eighteen months following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The predicted losses using MVaR are then compared with the actual ex-post results. Our objective is to analyze the extent of the cash flow transaction exposure and provide practical insights to MNEs as they decide whether or not they should hedge this risk. This study is noteworthy because it compares the pre- and post-COVID-19 periods.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nEthics is largely dominated by European curriculum which includes Western moral theories such as deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and care ethics. To decenter this dominant ethics curriculum, the present phenomenological study explored the moral lived experience of ethics for Korean Buddhist (male and female) monastics (N=21). Using three-level qualitative coding, data were thematically analyzed. Findings revealed three overarching themes (1) the importance of the sa\u1e45gha and community care, (2) the presence of ethical tensions, and (3) ethics as a practice. Each theme had two sub-themes. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of how these insights from the lived experience of Buddhist ethics may inform and advance social work ethics education beyond the Eurocentric curriculum.\n\nKEYWORDS: Decenter, ethics, lived experience, Buddhism, social work\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nNotes\n1. In other words, Therava\u02c9da is an Abhidharma tradition (the only one still in existence today), and Zen is a Maha\u02c9ya\u02c9na tradition.\n2. In Sanskrit, ana\u02c9tman (see Buswell & Lopez, Citation2014).\n3. Per Harvey (Citation2000), vinaya are rules.\n4. Per Buswell and Lopez (Citation2014), s\u00b4i\u00afla refers to ethical behavior (right speech, right action, right livelihood).\n5. Per Harvey (Citation2000), Bhikkhu and Bhikkhun\u012b are the Pa\u02c9li words for monk and nun.\n6. Per Buswell and Lopez (Citation2014), this is a Buddhist hybrid Sanskrit word. It is also referred to as samgha (p. 750). Sanga is a \u2018Pa\u02c9li and Sanskrit variation of community\u2019 (p. 768).\n7. Ana\u02c9tman replaces our traditional notion of the \u2018person\u2019 as a composite of five parts (skandhas): material (ru\u02c9pa), feeling/sensation (vedan\u0101), perception (sa\u1e43jn\u00b4a\u00af), mental activity/volition (sa\u1e43ska\u02c9ra), and consciousness (vij\u00f1a\u02c9na). \n\nBuswell, R.

The quantum cohomology ring QH*\u2062(IG) has negative structure constants. For \ud835\udc5b\u22653, we give a positivity condition that implies the quantum cohomology ring QH*(IG) is the only quantum deformation of the cohomology ring H*(IG) up to the scaling of the quantum parameter.

        "abstract": "Background:Palpitations are the second most common presenting symptom for cardiology visits. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders in patients with symptoms of arrhythmia, palpitations, is well documented but how this compares to patients at the greatest risk for major cardiac arrythmia is unknown.\n\nObjectives:The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of anxiety or depression in patients with symptomatic palpitations vs patients at risk for major cardiac arrhythmia (congestive heart failure) and further evaluate the effects on their quality of life using the SF-36 assessment tool.\n\nMethods:Patients with palpitations (50 subjects) or prior ICD (50 subjects) were given the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).\n\nResults:There was an insignificant trend for increased anxiety, with a mean GAD-7 score in palpitations group of 4.14 vs 3.04 in CHF group with anxiety prevalence in 40% palpitations and 28% of ICD patients. The mean score of PHQ-9 in palpitations group is 4.84 vs 4.96 in CHF group with 38% of the palpitation group having depression compared to 44% of the ICD group. The SF-36 physical function domain showed that the palpitations group was more functional than the ICD group with a mean score of 0.709 in palpitations group vs 0.513 in CHF group (P <0.05.) Subjective frequency of palpitations had a mean of 3.47 in the palpitation group vs 1.5 in the CHF group with P<0.05.\n\nConclusions:Patients presenting with symptomatic palpitations have more symptoms of anxiety than patients at risk for major arrythmia, but have less functional limitations than the ICD group, as expected. There is a non-significant trend to more anxiety in the palpitations group, but both groups are far above populations norms of 2-4%. Depression is not different between the groups but both groups are far above the population averages of 5-6%. Patients with palpitations have fewer physical limitations but have at least an equal amount of anxiety and depression as a far more ill group of patients. It is a standard of care to treat symptomatic palpitations due to PVCs with beta blockers; this will not help symptoms of anxiety and it may worsen depression. When seeing patients presenting with palpitations, or patients with chronic heart disease and an ICD, we should consider an evaluation for anxiety and depression.\n",

        "abstract": "Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) traditionally has been used in research concerning prospective and practicing classroom teachers. This essay argues that PCK is also relevant to other professions including those advancing quantitative reasoning (QR). To illustrate, the case of PCK for teaching QR is considered. Those in fields such as public health, journalism, meteorology, and government increasingly find themselves responsible for helping the public understand an ever-growing amount of quantitative information that has a bearing on societal well-being. Several examples illustrate how such professionals\u2019 responsibilities require knowing prevalent QR patterns in society, strategies for fostering sound reasoning, and the general nature of school curricula. Professional organizations in education, colleges of education, and educational researchers would benefit from expanding PCK research to encompass multiple professions. These expanded research and development efforts would simultaneously address urgent societal needs.\n",

Synoptic composites were constructed using the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) for all cases, as well as each cyclone group, using an LES repository spanning from 2006\u20132020. Additionally, 95 percent bootstrapped confidence intervals were created for each cyclone track to compare the initial mesoscale environmental properties (i.e., surface lake/air temperature and wind direction/speed) and LES impact (i.e., duration, maximum snowfall, and property damage). Synoptic composites of all LES cases exhibited an archetypal LES synoptic pattern consisting of an upper-level low geopotential height anomaly over the Hudson Bay and surface dipole structure centered across the Great Lakes basin. Regarding the different tracks, NEs and COs featured dynamic support in the form of enhanced turbulent mixing and synoptic vertical forcing, while ACs and GLs had greater thermodynamic support in the form of higher lapse rates and heightened heat and moisture fluxes. However, the bootstrapping analysis revealed minimal differences in LES impact between the cyclone types.\n",

        "abstract": "This article revolves around two soundtracks Walker has admired along with the person to whom this issue of Alphaville is dedicated: Danijela Kulezic-Wilson. The soundtracks come from Soul by Pete Docter and Kemp Powers and Nomadland by Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, both released in 2020. The films are sonically worlds apart: Soul is dominated by jazz music by Jon Batiste and contemporary electronic music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, while Nomadland features modern classical music by Ludovico Einaudi and \u00d3lafur Arnalds. Ironically, despite sounding profoundly different, both films draw from true stories in order to teach audioviewers about living well, even in the midst of death. Or, to reapply Danijela\u2019s words about Waking Life (Richard Linklater, 2001), these films emphasise \u201cthe dualistic nature of human experience, the pleasure of being alive and the implicit proximity of death.\u201d Walker combines cinematherapy with sound studies to make a case for the wisdom of both films that have helped her cope with the grief of Danijela\u2019s death, in the hope that this might resonate for those readers who find similar comfort in their own film-to-person relationships.\n",

        "abstract": "This exploratory study sought to address the gap in strengthening science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teacher preparation in elementary and secondary teacher education programs. Integrated STEM education is attracting increased attention and gaining momentum from educators, politicians, STEM industries, and the media across the nation. Many state and national organizations have called for a new workforce of problem solvers, innovators, and inventors who are self\u2010reliant and able to think logically, also suggesting that creating such capacity is one of the critical foundations that drive innovative capacity in the nation. A key to developing these skills is STEM competencies and career goals in every K\u201012 student. To do this, teachers must be educated on how to connect STEM careers and integrate STEM content into their curriculum. Providing integrated STEM micro\u2010credentials for preservice and in\u2010service teachers can be a flexible solution for providing teachers a method to learn how to improve their content knowledge and pedagogy (Digital Promise, 2019). Participants were a combination of undergraduate preservice teachers and graduate early\u2010career teachers who were asked about their STEM preparation. The majority of the participants received very little to no integrated STEM preparation. As a possible solution for this, participants were asked about their preferred type of professional development (PD) and if participating in a micro\u2010credential course would be a possibility. Nearly all of the participants agreed that a self\u2010paced micro\u2010credential that blended online and in\u2010person instruction would be something they would do to learn how to integrate STEM more effectively into their pedagogy. Micro\u2010credentials could be a successful solution for educator PD.\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractMulticultural Feminist Mentoring (MFM) models have provided an important foundation to address the further need for conceptualizing a mentoring model that is specific to Asian/Asian American (A/AA) experiences. In this collaborative autoethnography, six researchers in three mentor-mentee dyads explored what it means to pursue Asian/Asian American feminist mentoring (A/AAFM), through dyadic and group interactive dialogues and collaborative analysis. A/AAFM can be conceptualized as anti-racist praxis, where each mentor attempted to consider mentoring as activism within academia, being grounded in values stemming from A/AA experiences and feminism. Results yielded a model of A/AAFM which emphasizes a convergence of multifaceted racial and cultural identities, feminist values, and activism. Three specific processes emerged: being holistic, relational, and mutual; a focus on community and intergenerational generosity; and intentional flattening of the power hierarchy. Implications for training and activism are discussed. Keywords: Activism, Asian, Asian American, feminism, mentoring. Disclosure statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s). Notes: 1 In this paper we utilize the terminology Asian/Asian American (A/AA), with the recognition that there are numerous terms to refer to people of Asian descent in the US. We chose this terminology given the composition of our research group (i.e., individuals who identify as Asian and/or Asian American) who generated the mentoring model, and in order to include experiences of Asian international students. In addition, we did not use the term Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) in order to honor the unique experiences of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations, whose experiences we do not capture in this study. 2 In this paper, we utilize the terminology mentee to refer to individuals who may be more junior in experience and training in a mentoring relationship. When describing other scholars\u2019 contributions, we have reported the terminology used by the scholars that may be different from mentees (e.g., prot\u00e9g\u00e9s).\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nSolutions journalism is one of the newest alternative journalism strategies aimed at combating news fatigue through rigorous reporting on solutions to society's problems. One of the primary goals for the movement is increased source diversity that features more non-official and citizen voices, like those often used in other forms of alternative media. This study examined the types of sources journalists included in 555 text-based solutions journalism articles from the U.S., Europe, and Africa collected from the Solutions Journalism Network. The results indicate solutions stories are meeting the goals set forth by proponents of the movement, as they most frequently include nonprofits/groups and unaffiliated citizens. Solutions stories in American publications contained significantly more non-official sources than did their European and African counterparts, though these sources still comprised the majority of those used across all three continents. However, solutions stories included in the study contained fewer total sources than traditional news articles and still featured government and business sources regularly. This finding suggests solutions journalism practitioners may still have work to do to increase their use and variety of sources.\nKEYWORDS: Solutions journalism, source diversity, content analysis, alternative media, official sources, elite sources, unofficial sources, citizen sources\nDisclosure Statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n",

We show that applying preference parameter values from experimental settings to market data can significantly understate the role of prospect theory in explaining investor behavior. We find evidence that mutual fund investors exhibit loss aversion and differential attitudes toward risk over losses (risk-seeking) and gains (risk-averse) but no significant probability weighting when evaluating fund performance. Our results apply more strongly to retail funds compared to institutional funds, consistent with the view that prospect theory is more relevant for retail investors. Finally, we show that, for parameter values that best explain fund flows, prospect theory outperforms the global risk aversion framework and widely-used asset pricing models in explaining investors\u2019 responses to fund performance.\n\n### Keywords\nG11, G23, G40, loss aversion, mutual fund flows, prospect theory, reference-dependent preferences\n\n### Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n",

        "abstract": "Corporate social responsibility has received much attention regarding how it can benefit firms and why firms voluntarily address social issues. However, little is known about the problems to which firms choose to pay attention and what influences these decisions. We combine the attention\u2010based view of the firm and media agenda\u2010setting theories to propose that firms address the most prominent social issues as determined by the media. We analyze the frequency of 64 social issues in the CSR reports of 258 firms from 2006 to 2016 for a total sample of 86,208 issue\u2010firm\u2010year observations. We find that the salience of the problems in traditional media influences the social issues firms address in their CSR reports, and over time, the agenda\u2010setting effect of traditional media on firms has increased, solidifying traditional media's role as curators of social issues.\n",

One prevailing perspective (Barnett, Henriques & Husted, 2020; Barnett, Henriques & Husted, 2024) is that digital media leads to slacktivism, a token display of support, which impedes the ability of stakeholders to act collectively and makes it easier for firms to dismiss stakeholder claims. Another perspective (Colleoni, Zyglidopoulos & Illia, 2024) argues that even though synchronicity may be difficult to achieve, digital media in the form of hashtags makes it easier for heterogeneous stakeholders to converge around a broader demand for societal change and indirectly pressure firms to change their policies and practices. In this exchange, we expand on Colleoni, Zyglidopoulos, and Illia\u2019s (2024) arguments by encompassing other forms of digital activism beyond generic hashtags. Drawing from the logic of connective action, we argue that two universal pathways\u2014connectivity and velocity\u2014applicable across a wide range of digital activism, are reshaping and enhancing stakeholders\u2019 ability to influence a firm\u2019s social policies and practices.\n\nREFERENCES\nBarnett, M.

        "abstract": "This research article employs the continuous wavelet transform analysis to identify the climatological effects among various water quality parameters to identify the successfulness of upland stream restoration on the receiving mesohaline tidal creeks. Estuaries and their corresponding tidal creeks have been impacted by human anthropogenic influences for decades, allowing a variety of restoration practices to be implemented in upland streams. In the face of climate variability and continuous human development pressures, this research performs statistical analysis and a wavelet coherence on, before, and after stream restoration for water quality changes in Chesapeake Bay\u2019s tidal tributaries in the Lower Western Shore to identify if the restoration strategies have been effective in the mesohaline tidal creeks. Statistical analysis showed that currently, the receiving tidal basins are not seeing the required positive improvements in water quality after years of upland stream restoration. Compounding this is the fact climate variability cannot be ignored. Results indicate that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has significant wavelet coherence with bottom dissolved oxygen, precipitation, and nutrients. This suggests that current restoration efforts may not be able to keep up with climate variability, and other techniques (restoration or policies) may need to be implemented.\n",

Their participation in physical activity (PA) is influenced by many factors which will be explored in this study. The purpose of the study was to examine the interrelationships of PA enjoyment, exercise goal setting, exercise self-efficacy, and recording PA behaviors and the impact on PA. One thousand four hundred and seventy-six students at a public university in the United States responded to a questionnaire consisting of validated survey instruments regarding PA levels and exercise behaviors between 2014 and 2018. Exercise self-efficacy, PA enjoyment and recording PA were direct positive predictors of PA. Our findings reinforce the positive influence between PA enjoyment, exercise self-efficacy, and establishing exercise goals with increased PA. Particularly, exercise goal setting and PA enjoyment not only directly impact PA but also influence other model variables, underscoring their significance in enhancing PA among college students.\n",

        "abstract": "Aim/Purpose: The aim of this paper is to examine Gen Z students located in a representative region of the United States when it comes to technology use, news and information gathering behaviors, civic engagement, and social concerns and whether differences exist based on institutional type. The purpose is to report this information so that academics can better understand the behaviors, priorities, and interests of current American students.\n\nBackground: This paper investigates the mindset of Generation Z students living in the United States during a period of heightened civic unrest. Through the lens of the Theory of Generations, Uses and Gratifications Theory, and Intersectional Theory, this study aims to examine the Gen Z group and compare findings across populations.\n\nMethodology: An electronic survey was administered to students from 2019 through 2022. The survey included a combination of multiple responses, Likert scaled, dichotomous, open-ended, and ordinal questions. It was developed in the Survey Monkey system and reviewed by content and methodological experts to examine bias, vagueness, or potential semantic problems. The survey was pilot-tested in 2018 before implementation in order to explore the efficacy of the research methodology. It was then modified accordingly before widespread distribution to potential participants. The surveys were administered to students enrolled in classes taught by the authors, all of whom are educators. Participation was voluntary, optional, and anonymous. \n\nContribution: This paper provides insight into the mindset of Generation Z students living in the United States, which is helpful to members of academia who should be informed about the current generation of students in higher education. Studying Generation Z helps us understand the future and can provide insight into the shifting needs and expectations of society.\n\nFindings: According to the findings, Gen Z are heavy users of digital technologies who use social media as their primary source for gathering news about current events as well as information for schoolwork. The majority of respondents considered themselves to be social activists. When institutional type was considered, there were notable differences with the students at the Historically Black College or University (HBCU), noting the greatest concern with a number of pressing issues, including racial justice/Black Lives Matter, women\u2019s rights, gun violence, immigration reform, and human trafficking. Less significance across groups was found when LGBTQIA+ rights and climate change were considered.\n\nRecommendation for Researchers: As social media continues to proliferate in daily life and become a vital means of news and information gathering, additional studies such as the one presented here are needed. In other countries facing similarly turbulent times, measuring student interest, awareness, and engagement is highly informative.\n\nFuture Research: Future research will explore the role that influencers have in opinion formation and the information-gathering habits of Gen Z.\n",

        "abstract": "Feeding morphology permits animals to adapt to changing environments and is often under strong selection. We evaluated if bill shape varies according to differences in dietary prey taken across geographical ranges (North America, Central America, South America, and Caribbean islands) in a ubiquitous, New World raptor species, the American kestrel (Falco sparverius). Specifically, we predicted that bills in geographies where kestrels consumed a larger proportion of vertebrates would be shorter and wider, with a larger tomial tooth. We reviewed the literature on kestrel diets across their range and quantified potential differences in bill shape using geometric morphometric methods for 245 museum specimens. The literature review revealed that most prey consumed by kestrels in North, South, and Central America were invertebrates (51.6\u201369.1%), whereas Caribbean kestrels consumed mostly vertebrates (61.4%), most of which were reptiles (77.3%). Morphometric analyses agreed with these findings; bill shape differed for island versus mainland kestrels but not among mainland regions. Bill shape on islands reflected a more robust bill with a larger tomial tooth, but had a longer hook, which we suggest is adaptive for consumption of lizard prey, more available on islands due to reduced competition with other raptors compared to mainland regions.\n",

Data was analyzed, themed, and coded.\n\n**Results** A thematic analysis of the descriptions of wellness revealed 2 higher-ordered themes as whole-person and wellbeing, and 3 lower-ordered themes of balance, interconnectedness, and personalized in relation to participants\u2019 understanding of wellness.\n\n**Conclusions** The importance of balance between wellness dimensions and the acknowledgment of the interconnectedness of wellness dimensions are related to quality of life and life satisfaction. A deeper insight is needed to better understand the perceptions of wellness in this population to provide more effective interventions. This can be achieved through the development of enhanced pedagogy, which may improve student health.\n\n**Keywords:** Perceptions, wellness, emerging adults, college students, general education course.\n\n**Conflict of interest disclosure** The authors have no conflicts of interest to report. The authors confirm that the research presented in this article met the ethical guidelines, including adherence to the legal requirements, of United States of America and received approval from the Institutional Review Board of Point Loma Nazarene University (IRB # 18230), and participants provided informed consent.\n\n**Additional information**\n**Funding** The author(s) reported there is no funding associated with the work featured in this article.\n",

        "abstract": "We study whether the quality of the first job is lower for professional Asian nationals than for non-Asian nationals in the USA. With over a million professionals from Asia entering the US labor market in the past decade, a potential under placement may be both inefficient and discriminatory. We collected data on all newly hired assistant professors of management in research-intensive (R1) universities in the USA between 2010 and 2021. We focus on the quality of the university into which first hires are placed and examine whether first-job placement quality is lower for individuals who were born in East, South and Southeast Asia. We find that the quality and quantity of publication record are positively related to the quality of the placement and that Asian nationals have higher performance. However, Asian nationals are placed at lower-quality universities relative to their peers. Further, Asian nationals require a strong performance signal, in the form of first or second authorship on a publication to narrow the placement gap. Our results are explained by a combination of direct bias against applicants of Asian nationality and a requirement of a higher performance \u201cburden of proof\u201d from these applicants, compared to peers who are non-Asian nationals.\n",

        "abstract": "This study examined perceptions of and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic among 489 faculty from four public universities in the southeast United States. Data were collected via an online survey during the Fall 2020 semester, when campuses re-opened after closing in March. Two thirds of faculty perceived the severity of COVID-19 as severe, and their greatest concerns related to preventive behaviors, the possibility of a virus resurgence, and concern for the health of family/friends. The majority reported frequently engaging in COVID-19-preventing behaviors, which was highest among female and older faculty, and those with higher perceived severity and concern for personally contracting the virus. Over half of respondents reported teaching and scholarly activities were negatively impacted by the pandemic; most notable barriers to productivity included anxiety/stress and a distracted home environment. The study adds to the research on university faculty during the pandemic and aligns with research on the adult population.\n",

        "abstract": "Background:Bicycling is a healthy form of physical activity that can be performed by most adults as part of leisure-time (LT) activity. However, little is known about LT bicycling behaviors, especially in the rural areas of the United States. This study sought to contrast the prevalence and factors associated with LT bicycling in populations living in urban settings with those living in rural settings.Methods:The 2019 Behavior Risk Factor Survey, which contains information regarding LT physical activity behaviors among adults (N\u2009=\u2009396,261) in the United States, was used to determine the prevalence, demographic profile, and likelihood of meeting the physical activity guidelines of LT bicyclists. The 2013 National Center for Health Statistics Urban/Rural Classification Scheme was used to classify respondents living in rural and urban settings.Results:Among US adults, 3.8% (95% CI, 3.7\u20133.9) reported LT bicycling activity, the sixth most common physical activity. Adults living in urban counties compared with rural counties had a greater prevalence of LT bicycling (3.9% vs 2.3%, respectively), with adults living in rural counties having a 34% lower probability of LT bicycling. Rural bicycling prevalence rates were lower across all demographics. Urban bicyclists, compared with rural bicyclists, cycled more months of the year. Overall, 85.5% of all bicyclists met the aerobic physical guidelines, with no differences between urban and rural bicyclists.Conclusions:Bicycling remains an important LT physical activity among adults in the United States. However, a rural\u2013urban difference in the prevalence does exist for LT bicycling. The reasons for this disparity warrant further investigation.\n",

        "abstract": "## Objective:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic placed extreme burden on hospitals, while opioid overdose is another challenging public health issue. This study aimed to examine the trends and outcomes of opioid overdose hospitalizations in Pennsylvania during 2018 to 2021.\n\n## Design:\nWe identified opioid overdose hospitalizations in the state of Pennsylvania using the state-wide hospital discharge database (PHC4) 2018 to 2021. We examined the number of opioid overdose hospitalizations, the corresponding mortality and discharges against medical advice comparing the pre-COVID period (2018-2019) and the COVID period (2020-2021). We also assessed what patient and hospital characteristics were associated with in-hospital death or leaving against medical advice.\n\n## Results:\nA total of 13\u2009446 opioid-related hospitalizations were identified in 2018 to 2021. Compared to pre-pandemic, a higher percentage of cases involving synthetics (17.0%vs 10.3%, P\u2009<\u2009.0001) were observed during COVID. After controlling for covariates, there was no significant difference in opioid overdose in-hospital deaths in the years 2020 to 2021 compared to 2018 to 2019 (OR\u2009=\u20090.846, 95% CI: 0.71-1.01, P\u2009=\u2009.065). The COVID period was significantly associated with more leaving against medical advice compared to years 2018 to 2019 (OR\u2009=\u20091.265, 95% CI: 1.11-1.44, P\u2009=\u2009.0003). Compared to commercial insurance, Medicaid insurance was associated with higher odds of both in-hospital death (OR\u2009=\u20091.383, 95% CI: 1.06-1.81, P\u2009=\u2009.0176) and leaving against medical advice (OR\u2009=\u20091.903, 95% CI: 1.56-2.33, P\u2009<\u2009.0001).\n\n## Conclusion:\nThere were no substantial changes in the number of overall opioid overdose cases and deaths at hospitals following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania. This observation suggests that an increased number of patients may have succumbed to overdoses outside of hospital settings, possibly due to a higher severity of overdoses. Further, we found that patients were more likely to leave against medical advice during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThis study investigated the effect of limb occlusion pressure (LOP) position on exercise performance, cardiovascular responses, and perceptual experiences during seated bilateral leg extensions with and without blood flow restriction (BFR). Thirty resistance-trained males (age: 22 \u00b1 2 years; weight: 74.4 \u00b1 13.6 kg; height: 177.4 \u00b1 6.4 cm; BMI: 23.5 \u00b1 3.3 kg/m2) participated. Each performed exercise to failure (4 sets, 30% 1RM, 1 min rest) in three conditions: Supine LOP-BFR, Seated LOP-BFR, and no-BFR. BFR was applied at 60% LOP. Significant interaction effects were found for RPE (p = 0.021, d = 0.76), RPD (p < 0.01, d = 1.72), and DOMS (p < 0.01, d = 2.28). Statistically significant fewer repetitions were completed in Supine LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.5), Seated LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 1.0), and Seated LOP-BFR vs. Supine LOP-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.6). RPE was higher in Seated LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.52). RPD was higher in Supine LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.62) and Seated LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 1.25). DOMS was higher in Supine LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.77) and Seated LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 3.52). Seated LOP-BFR increased perceptual demands and reduced repetitions compared to Supine LOP-BFR. Both LOP-BFR conditions reduced repetitions compared to no-BFR without affecting cardiovascular measures.\n\nKEYWORDS: Blood flow restriction, resistance training, arterial occlusion pressure, occlusion training\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank the participants for volunteering their time and effort for the study.\n\nDisclosure statement\nNicholas Rolnick is the founder of the BFR PROS and teaches BFR training workshops to fitness and rehabilitation professionals using a variety of BFR training devices.\n\nData availability statement\nData is available upon reasonable request by contacting the corresponding author.\n\nAdditional information\nFunding\nThe author(s) reported there is no funding associated with the work featured in this article.\n",

        "abstract": "## Premise:\nSphagnum magellanicum(Sphagnaceae, Bryophyta) has been considered to be a single semi\u2010cosmopolitan species, but recent molecular analyses have shown that it comprises a complex of at least seven reciprocally monophyletic groups, that are difficult or impossible to distinguish morphologically.\n\n## Methods:\nNewly developed barcode markers and RADseq analyses were used to identify species among 808 samples from 119 sites. Molecular approaches were used to assess the geographic ranges of four North American species, the frequency at which they occur sympatrically, and ecological differentiation among them. Microhabitats were classified with regard to hydrology and shade. Hierarchical modelling of species communities was used to assess climate variation among the species. Climate niches were projected back to 22,000 years BP to assess the likelihood that the North American species had sympatric ranges during the late Pleistocene.\n\n## Results:\nThe species exhibited parallel morphological variation, making them extremely difficult to distinguish phenotypically. Two to three species frequently co\u2010occurred within peatlands. They had broadly overlapping microhabitat and climate niches. Barcode\u2010 versus RADseq\u2010based identifications were in conflict for 6% of the samples and always involvedS. diabolicumvs.S. magniae.\n\n## Conclusions:\nThese species co\u2010occur within peatlands at scales that could permit interbreeding, yet they remain largely distinct genetically and phylogenetically. The four cryptic species exhibited distinct geographic and ecological patterns. Conflicting identifications from barcode vs. RADseq analyses forS. diabolicumversusS. magniaecould reflect incomplete speciation or hybridization. They comprise a valuable study system for additional work on climate adaptation.\n",

        "abstract": "Recognizing food types through sensor signals for unseen users remains remarkably challenging, despite extensive recent studies. The efficacy of prior machine learning techniques is dwarfed by giant variations of data collected from multiple participants, partly because users have varied chewing habits and wear sensor devices in various manners. This work treats the problem as an instance of the domain adaptation problem, where each user represents a domain. We develop the first multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) method for food-typing recognition, which consists of three major components: stratified normalization, a multi-source domain adaptor, and adaptive ensemble learning. New techniques are developed for each component. Using a real-world dataset comprised of 15 participants, we demonstrate that our method achieves\\(1.33\\times\\)to\\(2.13\\times\\)improvement in accuracy compared with nine state-of-the-art MSDA baselines. Additionally, we perform an in-depth ablation study to examine the behavior of each component and confirm their efficacy.\n",

Investigations into specific behaviors and practices that influence arterial stiffness has been a priority in the past few years. Chronic aerobic and anaerobic exercise activity has consistently shown to attenuate or not influence markers of arterial stiffness in adults with chronic disease and otherwise healthy adults. Chronic high functional resistance training\u2019s effect on vascular compliance is less understood.\n\n**Purpose**: To determine the effects of a chronic high functional resistance training program on pulse wave velocity and beta-stiffness index.\n\n**Methods**: Participants (18-40 years old) were placed in a non-randomized fashion into high functional resistance training (HFRT) group (n = 9; >6 months of CrossFit experience; 4 female), or control (CON) group (n = 8; < 6 months of exercise experience; 6 female). Participants in the HFRT group trained at the same local facility 4 -5 days a week, utilizing the same training program. CON group refrained from exercise during the study period. Body composition, 1,000 meter rowing test, deadlift 1 repetition maximum (1 RM), hemodynamic assessments and vascular compliance was assessed at baseline and follow-up. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to examine within and between interactions on indices of arterial stiffness.\n\n**Results**: There were baseline differences between groups in deadlift 1 RM (72.3 \u00b1 18.2 kg mean difference (MD), p < 0.01), rowing time (143.8 \u00b1 35.7 sec MD, p < 0.01), and rowing average watts (153.8 \u00b1 34.6 watts MD, p < 0.01). Following the intervention, seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increased only in the CON group (3 \u00b1 4 mmHg MD, p = 0.04). No significant differences within and between group interactions were found in arterial stiffness variables.\n\n**Conclusions**: The findings indicate indices of arterial stiffness are not influenced by participation in chronic high functional resistance training.\n",

The impact of this type of training on arterial stiffness is less understood.\n\n**PURPOSE:** To investigate the acute effects of autoregulated (AR) and non-autoregulated (NAR) BFR exercise on indices of arterial stiffness. AR BFR training devices adjust pressure in the cuff ensuring similar pressure throughout the range of motion when the muscles are contracted (dilatated) and relaxed. NAR BFR training devices do not adjust pressure in the cuff throughout the range of motion when the muscles are contracted and relaxed which cause greater pressures at different points in the range of motion.\n\n**METHODS:** Following a randomized AR or NAR familiarization training session, 20 adults (23 \u00b1 5 years; 7 female) participated in 3 randomized treatment-order sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no-BFR separated by 1-week washout periods. Participants performed 4 sets of dumbbell wall squats to failure using 20% of 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) at 2-second concentric/eccentric cadence. Pneumatic straps were placed around the proximal portion of each thigh and training limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both the AT and NAR sessions. Testing before and immediately following the training session included ultrasonography of the carotid artery, applanation tonometry, and blood pressure acquisition. Two-way ANOVAs were used to examine the effects of treatment and the treatment-order interaction on pulse wave velocity (PWV), beta-stiffness index (\u03b2-stiff), and arterial compliance (AC).\n\n**RESULTS:** There were no baseline differences in CF- (carotid-femoral) PWV, CR- (carotid-radial) PWV, \u03b2-stiff, and AC (all p > 0.05). CF-PWV increased in the NAR-BFR (mean difference = 0.57 \u00b1 1.12 m/s, p = 0.02) and no-BFR (mean difference = 0.63 \u00b1 1.42 m/s, p = 0.03) groups following the exercise session. CR-PWV increased in the no-BFR (mean difference = 0.82 \u00b1 1.5 m/s, p = 0.03) group. And there was an interaction effect in CF-PWV between AR-BFR and NAR-BFR (mean difference = 0.70 \u00b1 1.6 m/s, p = 0.03).\n\n**CONCLUSION:** These findings show acute AR-BFR training does not influence indices of arterial stiffness while acute NAR-BFR training increases central stiffness.  \nCopyright \u00a9 2023 by the American College of Sports Medicine.\n",

        "abstract": "## Background:\nPrevious work from our lab has described a model of motor nerve degeneration in hyperglycemic zebrafish larvae which resembles mammalian models of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Here, we optimized the hyperglycemic\u2010induction protocol, characterized deficits in nerve structure and behavioral function, and then examined the regenerative potential following recovery from the hyperglycemic state.\n\n## Results:\nIn agreement with our previous work, hyperglycemia induced motor nerve degeneration and behavioral deficits. However, the optimized protocol initiated disruption of tight junctions within the blood\u2010nerve barrier, a phenotype apparent in mammalian models of DPN. Following a 10\u2010day recovery period, regeneration of motor nerve components was apparent, but behavioral deficits persisted. We next examined the effect of hyperglycemia on the musculoskeletal system and found subtle deficits in muscle that resolved following recovery, and robust deficits in the skeletal system which persisted following recovery.\n\n## Conclusion:\nHere we optimized our previous model of hyperglycemia\u2010induced motor nerve degeneration to more closely align with that observed in mammalian models and then characterized the regenerative potential following recovery from hyperglycemia. Notably, we observed striking impairments to skeletal development, which underscores the global impact hyperglycemia has across systems, and provides a framework for elucidating molecular mechanisms responsible for regenerative events moving forward.\n",

        "abstract": "Given the long-term human habitation and prolific land use change trajectories in the eastern United States, few remnants of the pre-European settlement Mid-Atlantic forest remain on the Atlantic Coastal Plain. This study utilized metes and bounds witness tree locations and descriptions produced during colonial land subdivision to understand the relationships between tree types and biogeographic environments for an area on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Using correspondence analysis, we reveal habitat partitioning among witness tree species based on soil drainage characteristics, that enable the visualization of a pre-European settlement reconstructed forest. Our research finds that oak ( Quercus), most often white oak ( Quercus alba), was the dominant genus for most of the study area underlain by well-drained soils. To a much smaller extent, gums were also associated with these well-drained soils. Areas of poor drainage most often contained pine ( Pinus) and an assemblage of different oaks ( Quercus spp.). Hickory ( Carya), also noted in the witness tree record in small numbers, was found across all soil drainages.\n",

FACSM\n\nAuthor Information \n1 University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, MD.\n2 Lehman College, New York, NY.\n3 Strength Together Inc., Rutherford, NJ.\n4 Salisbury University, Salisbury, MD. (Sponsor: Tim J. Werner, FACSM)\nMedicine & Science in Sports & Exercise 55(9S):p 156, September 2023. | DOI: 10.1249/01.mss.0000981168.98351.fb\n\nCurrent literature has reported evidence of muscle damage and rhabdomyolysis with very strenuous blood flow restriction (BFR) resistance exercise.\n\nPURPOSE: To compare the effects of autoregulated BFR (A-BFR), non-autoregulated BFR (NA-BFR), and no BFR on acute morphological adaptations of vastus lateralis (VL). A-BFR cuff pressure was automatically adjusted throughout the range of motion as muscle contracting. NA-BFR devices did not adjust the pressure in the cuff for muscle contraction.\n\nMETHODS: Following a randomized familiarization, 20 adults (23 \u00b1 5 years; 7 females) participated in 3 randomized treatment-order sessions with A-BFR, NA-BFR, and no BFR separated by 1-week washout periods. Participants performed four sets of wall squats to failure using 20% of 1-RM at 2-sec concentric/eccentric cadence and 1 min recovery between sets. Participants wore BFR cuffs at 60% of supine limb occlusion pressure (LOP) on top of their thighs. VL cross-sectional area (CSA) and echo intensity (EI) were assessed via ultrasound before and after each session. The scans were captured in the transverse plane at the mid-thigh of the right leg. Two-way ANOVAs were used for statistical analysis.\n\nRESULTS: No significant time \u00d7 treatment interaction (p > 0.05) was observed. However, there were significant main effects of treatment for CSA (p = 0.016) and EI (p = 0.019). Post hoc analyses showed significant differences between A-BFR and NA-BFR, while there were no other significant differences between treatments. Furthermore, significant main effects of time were observed in CSA (p = 0.000) and EI (p = 0.001). All treatments significantly (p < 0.05) increased CSA (A-BFR: 27.4 \u00b1 6.8 to 29.7 \u00b1 7.2 cm2, \u03b1%: 7.9 \u00b1 3.3; NA-BFR: 27.8 \u00b1 6.9 to 30.3 \u00b1 7.3 cm2, \u03b1%: 8.5 \u00b1 2.3; no BFR: 27.6 \u00b1 6.7 to 29.8 \u00b1 7.0 cm2, \u03b1%: 7.4 \u00b1 3.4) and EI (A-BFR: 65.3 \u00b1 10.5 to 67.5 \u00b1 10.5 au, \u03b1%: 3.3 \u00b1 4.9; NA-BFR: 68.6 \u00b1 10.2 to 73.5 \u00b1 11.0 au, \u03b1%: 6.1 \u00b1 9.0; no BFR: 67.6 \u00b1 9.6 to 70.8 \u00b1 10.9 au, \u03b1%: 4.1 \u00b1 6.6).\n\nCONCLUSION: Low-load resistance exercise to failure induces acute muscle swelling regardless of BFR. However, NA-BFR significantly increased CSA and EI compared to A-BFR. Since EI is inversely related to muscle quality, these findings suggest that autoregulated pressure in A-BFR can cause a lower fluid flux to the intracellular space and possibly less muscle damage and swelling than NA-BFR.

        "abstract": "Habitat loss and degradation affect populations in isolation while also modifying the intensity of interspecific interactions, which may be especially relevant for species of conservation concern coexisting with more common species. We explored habitat preferences and potential interspecific resource competition in the endangered Spotted Turtle (Clemmys guttata). For habitat data, water quality measurements were recorded once per trapping session, while canopy cover and vegetation data were recorded once per field season. We also investigated niche overlap in habitat and food resources between C. guttata and other, more common, turtle species. Our data indicated that the abundance of C. guttata was negatively correlated with dissolved O2 and pH levels and positively correlated with body of water depth and canopy cover. The investigation of niche overlap revealed that Mud Turtles (Kinosternon subrubrum) and Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta), but not Snapping Turtles (Chelydra serpentina), were negatively correlated with the abundance of C. guttata despite differences in characteristics of bodies of water used by each species. We used structural equation modeling to better understand if the relationships between C. guttata and other turtles were due to direct interactions or simply reflected environmental influences. We then used stable isotope analyses to compare similarities in \u03b413C and \u03b415N isotopes as proxies for diet overlap between C. guttata and other turtles and ultimately found that all species had similar, broad diets. The inverse relationship between abundance of C. guttata and other species, paired with the overlap in dietary niche space, suggests there is potential for interspecific interactions to negatively impact the abundance of C. guttata within turtle communities on the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The results of this study highlight that management efforts may need to consider that species of conservation concern coexist with more common species, especially as habitat loss decreases the breadth of habitat available.\n",

At its core, lesson study reflects a collaborative inquiry process, grounded in cycles of planning, enacting, and reflecting, that promotes teacher learning through active engagement in lesson refinement. In this article, we leverage lesson study as an exemplar case to foreground an examination and application of theory-based evaluation. We overview a novel evaluation framework contextualized to this multidimensional instructional program and draw out the contributions of theory-based evaluation to the study of program effects. To ground the description of this framework, we summarize representative findings from our ongoing evaluation of a lesson study-based instructional program and discuss processes for selecting, using, and managing evidence sources as well as determining causal strands supporting program outcomes. We conclude by discussing lessons learned and implications for theory-based evaluation of complex programs.\n",

        "abstract": "In the early 2000s, the Montgomery County (Maryland) Public School system implemented district\u2010wide changes to funding, curriculum, staffing, and technology. Using data from 1995 to 2014, we employ a difference\u2010in\u2010differences strategy to show that the reforms significantly increased the percentage of students in Montgomery County who scored advanced on third\u2010 and fifth\u2010grade math and reading tests. Using an event study strategy, we find that the positive impacts extended through the end of the panel. Our results contribute to the literature on school reform by finding positive impacts of school reform in a district that was high performing prior to reforms.\n",

        "abstract": "Habitat loss, degradation, and modification are important drivers of global population declines in amphibians. Most amphibians have a biphasic lifestyle and are susceptible to threats in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Eastern Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum) are endangered throughout much of their range in the eastern United States, including Maryland and Delaware. Ambystoma t. tigrinum breed in ephemeral freshwater ponds and then migrate into the surrounding terrestrial environment after metamorphosis. Limited research exists about what habitat characteristics play a role in breeding pond use. We sought to understand what features of the breeding pond and surrounding landscape influence abundance and occupancy. We measured salamander occupancy, salamander abundance, and water quality parameters at ponds during the 2018 and 2019 breeding seasons. We used geographic information systems to determine pond area and the percentage of forest area and road density surrounding a pond at four spatial scales. Pond occupancy by A. t. tigrinum was positively associated with increased depth and less forest cover at the largest spatial scales. Abundance of A. t. tigrinum was greatest in larger, deeper ponds, potentially because these factors increase hydroperiod. More basic pH and decreased conductivity were also associated with higher male salamander abundances in ponds. Forest area and road density were not in the top-ranked model, although we note that ponds in this study had a minimum of 70% forest area within 150 m. Our findings elucidate relationships between A. t. tigrinum and their habitat, providing knowledge for future management of this state-endangered species. Journal of Herpetology publishes on the biology of amphibians and reptiles, emphasis on behavior, conservation, ecology, evolution, morphology, and physiology.\n",

        "abstract": "The study seeks to confront the challenge of incorporating the role of inequality, identity, and intersectionality into political science teaching and learning. In this quasi-experimental design, we explore the variation in two introductory courses in public policy. The design and content were similar for both sections. For the experimental section, we integrated intersectional political science pedagogy. This section employed a flipped classroom, introducing innovative approaches to grading and assessment that were accessible, inclusive, and anti-racist. In the control group section, the course was traditionally taught without supplemental material on intersectionality or the more innovative and unconventional pedagogy. We hypothesize that students enrolled in the intersectional section will have more interest and knowledge in public policy, as well as a deeper understanding of racial progress as it relates to the policy process. Moreover, we predict that students will display some resistance and discomfort when it comes to participating in class discussions.\n",

Exploring influential factors and interventions associated with PA of this population is pertinent in increasing engagement and adherence.\nPURPOSE: To examine the impact of motivational interviewing (MI) on anthropometric measures, PA, and exercise motivation during an 8-week intervention.\nMETHODS: Nine students at a U.S. public university responded to a questionnaire fall 2021 and completed anthropometric measurements at 3 different time points: pre-, mid-, and post-intervention. The intervention consisted of 3 exercise days per week for approximately 30 minutes. The questionnaire consisted of validated survey instruments regarding PA levels, feelings toward PA, motivation, exercise self-efficacy, and general lifestyle behaviors. Repeated measures ANOVAs examined the differences from each time point for each variable.\nRESULTS: There was a significant increase in the motivation to exercise to spend time with friends from pre-evaluation to post-evaluation (p = 0.01) with a strong effect size (Cohen\u2019s d = 1.05). There was a significant improvement in the motivation to become more agile from pre-evaluation to post-evaluation (p = 0.01) as well as from pre-evaluation to mid-point evaluation (p = 0.004) with large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s d = 1.33, Cohen\u2019s d = 1.17 respectively). There was a significant improvement in the motivation to exercise to recover from illness or injury from pre-evaluation to post-evaluation (p = 0.02) with a large effect size (Cohen\u2019s d = 0.96) and from pre-evaluation to mid-point evaluation (p = 0.04) a large effect size (Cohen\u2019s d = 1.74). No significant differences were found for any other variables.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings support motivational interviewing as effective in improving exercise motivation.\n\nTable 1 -\n           Participant Demographics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nResponse\n\n\n% Subjects/M(SD)\n\n\n\nSex\nMale (n = 2)\n22.22%\n\n\n\nFemale (n = 7)\n77.78%\n\n\nClass Year\nFreshman (n = 5)\n55.56%\n\n\n\nSophomore (n = 2)\n22.22%\n\n\n\nJunior (n = 2)\n22.22%\n\n\nRace\nNH White (n = 5)\n55.56%\n\n\n\nNH Black (n = 2)\n22.22%\n\n\n\nAsian American (n = 1)\n11.11%\n\n\n\nOther (n = 1)\n11.11%\n\n\nAge\n\n21.22 (7.84)\n\n\nGPA\n\n3.52 (0.26)\n\n\n\n\nN = 9.Abbreviations: M, mean; SD, standard deviation, NH, non-Hispanic.\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 by the American College of Sports MedicineView full article text\n",

        "abstract": "Sex\u2010biased dispersal is common in many animals, with male\u2010biased dispersal often found in studies of mammals and reptiles, including interpretations of spatial genetic structure, ostensibly as a result of male\u2013male competition and a lack of male parental care. Few studies of sex\u2010biased dispersal have been conducted in turtles, but a handful of studies, in saltwater turtles and in terrestrial turtles, have detected male\u2010biased dispersal as expected. We tested for sex\u2010biased dispersal in the endangered freshwater turtle, the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) by investigating fine\u2010scale genetic spatial structure of males and females. We found significant spatial genetic structure in both sexes, but the patterns mimicked each other. Both males and females typically had higher than expected relatedness at distances <25\u2009km, and in many distance classes greater than 25\u2009km, less than expected relatedness. Similar patterns were apparent whether we used only loci in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (n=\u00a07) or also included loci with potential null alleles (n=\u00a05). We conclude that, contrary to expectations, sex\u2010biased dispersal is not occurring in this species, possibly related to the reverse sexual dimorphism in this species, with females having brighter colors. We did, however, detect significant spatial genetic structure in males and females, separate and combined, showing philopatry within a genetic patch size of <25\u2009km inC.\u00a0guttata, which is concerning for an endangered species whose populations are often separated by distances greater than the genetic patch size.\n",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Elevated aortic and carotid artery stiffness are associated with subclinical brain damage and cognitive impairment. Fish oil (FO) is a popular dietary supplement that lowers blood pressure and aortic stiffness. However, the hypothesis that FO supplementation reduces carotid artery stiffness and improves cognitive function in healthy adults requires further investigation. Our objective was to determine the effects of FO supplementation on arterial stiffness and cognitive function in healthy adults. We hypothesized that 6-weeks of FO supplementation would lower arterial stiffness and improve cognitive function. Methods: 25 healthy adults were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arms intervention to investigate the effects of 6-week FO supplementation (4g/day) on vascular and cognitive function. Aortic stiffness was measured using applanation tonometry and quantified as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and beta-stiffness index (bstiff), and carotid artery stiffness was determined using ultrasonography. Cognitive function was assessed using NIH toolbox cognitive battery. A two-way analysis of variance was used to test differences in treatment groups over time. Results: The mean (\u00b1 SD) baseline age, body mass index, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure was 40.4 \u00b1 20.6 years, 23.7 \u00b1 2.4 kg/m2, 120.9 \u00b1 14.7 mmHg, and 74.9 \u00b1 12.4 mmHg in the fish oil group and 33.3 \u00b1 14.5 years, 25.3 \u00b1 3.9 kg/m2, 120.8 \u00b1 6.4 mmHg, and 71.9 \u00b1 7.8 mmHg in the placebo group, respectively. Compared to the national averages, our participants scored slightly above average (within one standard deviation) on all tests within the NIH cognitive battery. Within-group comparison revealed no differences in central or peripheral blood pressure, aortic or carotid stiffness, and cognitive function after fish oil supplementation (all p>0.05). Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest that in healthy, cognitively normal adults, 6- weeks of FO supplementation does not impact indices of arterial stiffness or cognitive function. Further investigation with more participants and of longer duration is needed to confirm our findings regarding the effects of fish oil supplementation on carotid artery stiffness and cognitive function.\n\nThis is the full abstract presented at the American Physiology Summit 2023 meeting and is only available in HTML format.

Parallel architectures can offer a notable reduction in complexity. We propose a stable matching algorithm using n2 processors that converges in O(nlog(n)) average runtime. The algorithm is structurally based on the Parallel Iterative Improvement (PII) Algorithm, which successfully finds a stable matching in approximately 90% of cases. We suggest an alternative selection method for pairs in the PII algorithm, called Dynamic Selection, leading to an algorithm that fully converges over 200,000 trials and generally converges much faster. We also suggest the Right-Minimum selection method, leading to an algorithm which converges in approximately 99.9% of cases and can be combined with the PII-SC algorithm's cycle detection and Gale-Shapley Initiation to remove all cycles observed thus far.\n\nIndex Terms\nPoster: Dynamic and NM1-Right Selection for the Parallel Iterative Improvement Stable Matching Algorithm\nTheory of computation\nDesign and analysis of algorithms\nParallel algorithms\n\nPublished In\nMobiHoc '23: Proceedings of the Twenty-fourth International Symposium on Theory, Algorithmic Foundations, and Protocol Design for Mobile Networks and Mobile Computing\nOctober 2023\n\nContributors\nAlec Kyritsis - Middlebury College, Middlebury, Vermont, USA\nScott Wynn - University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA\nStephora Cesar Alberi - Salisbury University, Salisbury, Maryland, USA\nEnyue Lu - Salisbury University, Salisbury, Maryland, USA\n",

        "abstract": "As the roles of faculty members have continued to expand, leaders in higher education need a better understanding of the drivers of faculty engagement. The current paper develops and tests a hypothesized model of faculty engagement in which faculty member grit is positively related to faculty member engagement both directly and indirectly through faculty member\u2013academic chair leader member exchange (LMX). Using a sample of 156 faculty members in a mid\u2010sized public university in the mid\u2010Atlantic region of the United States, we tested the hypothesized model using PROCESS Model 4 with 5000 boot\u2010strapped samples and a 95% confidence interval. Results show significant direct positive relationships between faculty member grit and faculty member engagement and between faculty member\u2013academic chair LMX and faculty member engagement, but no significant indirect relationship of faculty member grit through LMX. Implications for higher education leaders are discussed, along with limitations and directions for future research.\n",

        "abstract": "With the implementation of the Next Generation NCLEX-RN (NGN) national licensing examination in April of 2023, faculty in state of Maryland nursing schools were solicited for participation in a Maryland Nursing Workforce Center grant initiative to develop a repository of NGN case studies. A major change in the exam was the integration of a six-step clinical judgment model using a case-based format with client information presented in an electronic medical record using new question types designated for each of the steps presented sequentially. Twenty faculty \u201cchampions\u201d from 13 Maryland schools attended several training sessions and were to develop two peer-reviewed cases for inclusion in the Qualtrics database. Once approved, these cases could then be accessed online via a secure link or QR code by Maryland-based nursing faculty and shared with students for instructional and practice purposes. Two gero-focused cases were developed. The first case focused on an older adult in a long-term care facility admitted to the hospital for a urinary tract infection with potential complication of urosepsis. Another featured a hospitalized older adult client with Alzheimer\u2019s disease admitted from home with dehydration with potential for delirium superimposed on dementia. While a major objective of this innovative and proactive state-wide initiative is to optimize success on the modified NCLEX-RN, it is also hoped that these case examples, when appropriately integrated into the nursing curriculum, will enhance understanding of common geriatric scenarios and better prepare graduates for safe, effective nursing care of older adults.\n",

        "abstract": "## Background:\nThere is increasing interest in understanding the relationship between social capital and undesirable health outcomes. Social capital theory suggests that better health outcomes may result from certain \u201cneighborly\u201d aspects of social capital.\n\n## Methods:\nThis study used secondary data from the Social Capital Index. Bivariate correlations were calculated between neighborly social capital and health outcome variables. Next, neighborly social capital variables were entered as predictors of health outcomes in a series of stepwise regressions. Regional comparisons were conducted across four U.S. regions. Comparisons of the regression model structures were conducted by applying a model derived from one region to the data from another region and contrasting the resulting crossed R2 with the original direct R2 to identify differential regression weights across the four regions that warrant interpretation.\n\n## Results:\nThe correlation and regression analyses showed significant negative relationships between three neighborly social capital variables (% who do favors for their neighbors, % who worked with neighbors to improve something, and % who trust all or most of their neighbors) and health outcomes including: % in fair/poor health, premature mortality rate, % diabetic, and % obese. In regional comparisons, only the South region had a direct and crossed R2 significantly different from other regions, with this difference largely attributable to an unexpected positive relationship between trusting neighbors and negative health outcomes in the South.\n\n## Conclusions:\nInterventions to increase neighborly social capital may help to alleviate negative health outcomes in the U.S. Anomalously, in the South, trusting neighbors may be related to worse health outcomes.\n\n## Key messages:\n\u2022\u2003Being neighborly may enhance positive health outcomes in most parts of the U.S.\n\n\u2022\u2003Strong social support impacts urban health.\n",

The existing challenges of the dominance of moral absolutes and Eurocentric ethics curriculum were examined. Three change processes were proposed to help build a futuristic infrastructure for ethics praxis with a thicker, more equitable, and more inclusive moral social fabric. This \u201cradical imaginary\u201d promotes anti-racist and anti-oppressive ethics praxis that seeks to eliminate both ethical social isolation and ethics-based racism.KEYWORDS: Epistemic justice, ethics, race, ethnicity, culture, grand challenges.

        "abstract": "AbstractObjective Sexual victimization experience is a health concern among college students and rape empathy may help address it. Empathy with a rape victim was examined based on sexual victimization experience, acknowledgment (i.e., labeling experience \u201csexual assault,\u201d \u201crape\u201d), and gender.Method Undergraduates (n=531) completed measures of sexual victimization experience and rape empathy.Results Acknowledged victims reported greater empathy than unacknowledged victims and nonvictims, but the latter two groups did not differ. Unacknowledged female victims reported greater empathy than unacknowledged male victims, but no gender difference emerged for acknowledged victims or nonvictims. Victimized men were less likely than victimized women to acknowledge their experience.Conclusions The association found between acknowledgment and empathy may inform efforts to address sexual victimization (e.g., prevention, victim support), and men should not be overlooked. Unacknowledged victims and greater acknowledgment rates among women than men may have contributed to previously reported gender differences in rape empathy.Keywords: Acknowledgment labeling, gender, rape empathy, sexual victimization. Conflict of interest disclosure: The authors have no conflicts of interest to report. The authors confirm that the research presented in this article met the ethical guidelines, including adherence to the legal requirements, of the United States of America and received approval from the Institutional Review Board of Salisbury University.\n",

        "abstract": "Science should provide students an accurate and contemporary education on genetic influence, particularly how it impacts trait variability and developmental norms. Stories involving familial, racial, and sexual differences routinely appear in the popular media and sales of over\u2010the\u2010counter genetic tests are mounting. Unfortunately, research suggests genetic curricula in secondary education and university courses have little impact on genetic literacy; instead they appear to amplify genetic essentialism. This position paper reports on genetic essentialism, the impact of three components of science education (teachers, students, curriculum), and critiques existing genetic lessons in two prevalent scientific disciplines, biology and psychology. Two entrenched 19th century genetic paradigms (e.g., Mendelian inheritance and behavioral genetics) are specifically examined. The paper closes with specific recommendations for improving students' genetic literacy including important contemporary genetic science (e.g., epigenetics) and instructional approaches (e.g., learning progression, refutational teaching).\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nLower sexual satisfaction with one\u2019s current partner (SSCP) has been associated with having a history of sexual victimization experience (SVE). However, whether or not this SVE involved the current partner as the perpetrator has been unclear. This study aimed to address this gap in the sexual health literature by examining women\u2019s SSCP based on SVE with that current partner (yes; no) and/or a different perpetrator (yes; no). A convenience sample of undergraduate women with an exclusive current partner (n\u202f=\u202f412; 99 percent unmarried) at a U.S. public university anonymously responded via paper-and-pencil to the Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction and the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization between 2012\u20132016. A 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 ANOVA revealed that current-partner SVE was associated with lower SSCP (F (1, 410)\u202f=\u202f7.38, p\u202f=\u202f.007, partial n2\u202f=\u202f.018), but other-perpetrator SVE was not. SVE may predict lower SSCP when victimized by that partner, as that partner may be associated with the negative victimization experience. Although preliminary, findings highlight the importance of considering how partner-related health factors (e.g. SSCP) may be differentially associated with SVE based on whether or not the victim\u2019s current partner was the perpetrator.\n\nKEYWORDS: Current partner, satisfaction, sexual victimization\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nAdditional information\nFunding\nThe author(s) reported there is no funding associated with the work featured in this article.\n",

Multiple jobholders work various combinations of part-time and full-time jobs, which suggests they might spend their time differently than single jobholders, and the second job might affect an individual's subjective well-being. Using data from the 2003-2019 American Time Use Survey, I show that multiple jobholders work and commute more, and spend less time relaxing, sleeping, and doing housework than single jobholders. Overall, multiple jobholders are less likely to report being rested and having a good life relative to single jobholders. I also show how these differences vary by gender and race.\n",

Walking on different surfaces causes different foot-floor friction patterns. We proposed to deploy motion sensors near the ankle to sense foot-floor friction and recognize walking surfaces. There are two contributions in this proposed research work. First, we demonstrated that the proposed method is capable of distinguishing five most-common walking surfaces in daily living. Second, we compare the detection accuracy between walking normally and dragging feet while walking. Experimental results show the proposed method obtains higher accuracy for dragging feet while walking, which reaches 90.6% using only five seconds of data.\n\n**Keywords:** walking surface detection, motion sensors, foot-floor friction\n\n**Index Terms:** Human-centered computing, Ubiquitous and mobile computing, Ubiquitous and mobile computing systems and tools\n\n**Authors Info & Claims:**\n- Shuangquan Wang, Salisbury University, Salisbury, MD, USA\n- Gang Zhou, William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA\n\n**Citation Metrics:** Total Citations: 0, Total Downloads: 37, Last 12 Months: 37, Last 6 weeks: 4\n",

The frequency and intensity of extreme weather conditions due to human-induced climate change have alarmingly increased. Consequently, climate change directly affects environmental sustainability and human mortality in the short term and creates prolonged and complicated long-term indirect grave risks. This paper examines three-level environmental impact risks associated with climate change on human mortality. It proposes a conceptual framework for developing an empirical event-based human mortality database related to climate change and communication strategies to enhance global environmental adaptation, resilience, and sustainability.\n",

This paper traces publishing trends from the 100 most cited papers in the decades from 1970 to 2019 (500 papers in total). Data suggest that the field has become more empirical and that the structure of papers is more standardized, often following a format that is closer to that of scientific papers. Increases in the percentage of women first\u2010listed authors and the gender ratio are noted and found to be correlated with emerging fields. Most interestingly, a decreasing number of highly cited papers are from what are generally considered the \u201cTop 5\u201d journals in economics, suggesting increasing importance of articles published outside of the Top 5.\n",

        "abstract": "## Abstract\nThis study uses Monte Carlo simulation to examine the success of the monthly withdrawal of funds from portfolios consisting of U.S. large capitalization stocks, U.S. corporate bonds, and real estate investment trusts (REITs). The objective of this research is to provide an empirical examination of the effect of diversification with REITs on the withdrawal of funds from a retirement portfolio. We compare portfolios consisting of large capitalization stocks and corporate bonds to portfolios consisting of large capitalization stocks, corporate bonds, and REITs. We examine both portfolio compositions using a variety of portfolio weights, fund withdrawal rates, and fund withdrawal periods. The results of the study indicate that, in general, portfolios with REITs had a greater likelihood of sustaining a given number of withdrawals over this time. The results of this study can be used for retirement planning since they provide a historical perspective on the success of various withdrawal rates. Our results indicate that REITs, when added to a portfolio of stocks and bonds, can increase the success rates for a withdrawal portfolio. This indicates that individuals and large investment funds would likely benefit from adding REITs to a withdrawal portfolio of stocks and bonds.\n\n**Keywords:** REITs, Portfolio diversification, Retirement planning\n\n## Acknowledgments\nWe would also like to thank Martha Peyton, Michael Grupe, and Kimberly Goodwin for comments on a previous version of this paper.\n\n## Notes\n1. Although we begin with an arbitrary amount of $1,000,000, the sustainable withdrawal rate is the same for any beginning portfolio value since we are concerned with a percentage withdrawal.\n2. Using the returns for large capitalization stocks and long-term corporate bonds from 1926\u20132021 instead of the returns from 1972\u20132021 produced success rates similar to other research in this area.\n\n## Additional information\n**Funding:** We would like to thank the Real Estate Research Institute (RERI) for financial support on the research.\n",

Through qualitative interviews with U.S. LGBTQ+ residents (N = 19), we explore what LGBTQ+ people experienced from LGBTQ+ serving organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the challenges, barriers, and support that LGBTQ+ people encountered, the meaning they received from LGBTQ+ serving organizations, and the tensions between caring for self and others. We provide recommendations for how LGBTQ+ serving organizations can better meet the needs of diverse LGBTQ+ people.\nKeywords: COVID-19, LGBTQ+, LGBTQ+ organizations, support groups, zoom\nAcknowledgements The authors thank Emily Bramande, Whitney Demond, Amy Lambert, Ashley Olortegui, and Allyson Rivera for their assistance on this project, as well as the participants who took the time to speak with us and share their stories.\nEthical Approval This study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Belmont Report.

To illustrate this, we provide examples from three courses in the disciplines of industrial engineering and applied linguistics: Project Analysis and Control, Manufacturing Processes, and Introduction to Linguistics. Our examination of ChatGPT focuses on how some of the common, but time-consuming, tasks can be generated by using ChatGPT as a supportive instructional tool. We observed in our analysis that ChatGPT demonstrates a high level of performance in generating assessment questions and tasks that are accurate and on-topic, and a level of creativity and flexibility in its question generation capabilities. However, it is important to note that ChatGPT is not designed to replace human expertise or judgment. It is crucial that instructors carefully evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the assessments or information generated by ChatGPT.\n",

        "abstract": "Numerous states have altered the sales factor weight in their corporate income tax (CIT) apportionment formulas. We are among the first to examine which political and economic factors are important in determining whether and when states manipulate sales factor weights. We apply survival model techniques to a panel of state-level data for the years 1985\u22122012. Our most striking result is that a higher CIT rate is associated with faster movement to a higher sales factor weight. Perhaps indicating that, for economic development, states use sales factor manipulation in lieu of reducing CIT rates broadly, or alternatively, that states raise sales factor weights to compensate for higher statutory CIT rates. Results also indicate that stronger growth in the CIT base and in non-corporate tax revenues hasten sales factor weight increases. Democratic control of the state government and gubernatorial election years are also important in the timing of sales factor manipulation.\n",

        "abstract": "Food retailing in developing economies has undergone significant transformations over the past three decades. Progressing in three waves across regions like Latin America, Asia, Africa, and beyond, food retailers have transitioned from traditional open markets to modern supermarkets akin to those in more developed economies. In this article, we provide an overview of the structure of food retailing in developing economies and examine the empirical literature that delves into the reasons behind the evolution of retailers in developing countries worldwide, as well as their impact on suppliers and consumers. We propose avenues for future research, building upon an empirical framework that recognizes the consumer\u2010driven nature of retail evolution and how the structure of retailing develops as an equilibrium outcome within a dynamic, imperfectly competitive environment. In conclusion, we identify significant gaps in the existing empirical literature and shed light on emerging questions that are likely to gain importance in the future.

        "abstract": "## Background:\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, with 20% of deaths in adults under age 65. Commercial drivers have an increased CVD incidence rate of 50% compared to 30% for the general population, yet one third of drivers will not be screened for risk factors due to a lack of insurance or primary care. With approximately 3.5 million commercial drivers nationally and correlation of CVD to increased motor vehicle accidents, fatalities, and excessive healthcare costs, addressing the care gap for this high-risk population is imperative.\n\n## Methods:\nAn evidence-based practice (EBP) project synthesized the literature and implemented CVD risk screening for commercial drivers examined in an occupational practice setting. Using the non-laboratory Framingham CVD risk score calculator, over 90% of drivers were screened during mandated medical examinations and provided education regarding modifiable risk factors during a 2-month period.\n\n## Findings:\nOver 40% of commercial drivers were at high risk for CVD with 25% uninsured and 32% without primary care. The average CVD risk score was twice the general population\u2019s risk score, with obesity, hypertension, and smoking being the most common risk factors discussed.\n\n## Conclusions/Application to Practice:\nIncorporating CVD risk screening and education during opportune encounters is logical, efficient, and financially prudent. The EBP change supports occupational professionals\u2019 standards, and ongoing review of CVD screening guidelines with integration into practice provides health promotion and promotes public safety for these essential workers.\n",

        "abstract": "## Abstract\nAmong US presidents, Herbert Hoover and Lyndon Johnson had the strongest ties to Australia. Hoover spent over a year in Australia as a mining engineer before launching a career in international business, food relief, and politics. In 1942, LBJ passed part of his pre-presidential career in Australia. Yet Johnson\u2019s presidential tour in 1966, coupled with his return in 1967, generated massive enthusiasm and modest protests against the Vietnam War. President Johnson\u2019s visits helped to solidify and celebrate US-Australian ties while encouraging Australian independence, even if during a war directed from Washington. While Hoover left his mark on Australia\u2019s landscape in the mines he promoted and the sites that still stand, Australians found little appealing in the dour, Depression-era president who had come and gone without regarding their country as a friend or ally. Johnson thus became a consequential figure in Australia\u2019s national history in ways Hoover never did.\n\n## Acknowledgments\nThe author presented early versions of this article at the European Association for Studies of Australia conference in 2023 and at Bruce Hall, the Australian National University in 2022.

This article argues that the starting point for theologizing about providence ought to be the logic of radical generosity in play when the divine Thou creates historical time as a reality unto itself by giving it an unprecedented future. Providence does not protect the historically conditioned universe from this future; it draws the universe into it. The human experience of grace offers us a paradigmatic example of this.\n",

        "abstract": "Identity formation in undergraduate teacher preparation programs is often challenging for teacher candidates. Future teachers sometimes find themselves in tension-filled situations where university preparation program practices contradict expectations of elementary school internships or their beliefs about teaching children. Often, teacher candidates are relegated to two choices: conform to the internship context, survive, or resist and risk potential denial to the system towards which they feel dissonance . This chapter shows how two teacher candidates in a two-year full-time teacher residency preparation program felt dissonance towards their internship setting mentor teachers and how they leveraged the structure of their university program to advance their teaching status in those contexts. Through scapegoating the literacy content coach and coaching cycle, Megan and Natalie impacted children's learning experiences and their teacher identities.\n",

Analysis of fieldnotes from 30 observations, student writing products, and reflective interviews with focal students and the teacher illuminated the meaningful assemblages where conditions of intimacy permeated instruction. Two practices supported intimacy in working conditions: knowledge about writing built through a collective process of noticing, and open-ended work time characterized by \u201cmanaged nonmanagement\u201d (, p. 176), or calculated flexibility in rules and expectations. Findings illustrate how a literacy practice might contribute to students\u2019 experience of alienation or intimacy (or both) while writing, depending on conditions of industrialization and commodification. Even as the teacher strove to deindustrialize work, commodification through grades and standardized assessments heightened alienation in the writing environment. The study provides an example of an educational context governed by an industrial system of assessment where local actors (the teacher and students) disrupted alienation by working in smaller scales and more closely with texts.\n",

Based on the decision tree analysis, we develop a new multivariate information metric, Internal Relevance (IR), to measure the extent to which the revisions of analysts\u2019 consensus earnings and sales forecasts are incorporated into the revisions of consensus target prices. We show that stocks with higher IR have stronger market reactions to target price revisions in terms of abnormal return, abnormal trading volume, and abnormal return volatility. These results remain consistent across a series of robustness checks. Finally, we perform portfolio analysis to show that IR can be used to screen stocks to improve trading profitability.\n\nKEYWORDS: Decision tree analysis, earnings and sales forecasts, market reactions, target prices, portfolio analysis\n\nJEL CLASSIFICATION: G10, G24, G14, G11\n\nDisclosure statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n",

        "abstract": "Between Images proposes a unique theory of montage as a technique of relation: a means of fundamentally rethinking and reshaping how humans relate\u2014to ourselves and each other, to the material world, to the planet and its nonhuman inhabitants. Historically, film criticism has cast montage in one of several roles: as narrative\u2019s invisible executor of spatiotemporal continuity to maintain the viewer\u2019s investment in the story-world; as an agent of disorder that confounds conventions of storytelling and realism and prompts the viewer\u2019s intellectual engagement; and as an expressionistic device for augmenting the duration and combination of shots to affect viewers at a sensory level. While not exactly abandoning such accounts, this study tries to move closer to the heart of montage by distinguishing the space between images as itself a powerful source of ideas, feelings, and forms. Venturing into an \u201cexpanded field of montage\u201d beyond the limited purview of a given film\u2019s \u201cediting,\u201d Between Images traces the cut and the splice across photographic and cinematic media in a range of material, conceptual, and political contexts. In all of this, the space between images becomes a setting for navigating and renegotiating the terms of relation, of the \u201cbeing-with\u201d that connects all forms of life. Between Images brings together a diverse cast of experimental filmmakers, including Harun Farocki, Hito Steyerl, Steve McQueen, Cauleen Smith, Da\u00efchi Saito, and Ja\u2019Tovia Gary, and in doing so, situates the cinematic cut within an interdisciplinary conversation about the abiding capacity of cinema to effect change.\n",

        "abstract": "Recent disruptions, labor shortages, and fiscal pressures, especially in retail service environments, have necessitated and highlighted changes in the roles and responsibilities of frontline employees, often requiring them to enforce mask mandates and police customer deviant behavior (CDB). While extant work has investigated the impact of policing, or guardianship, for customers and firms, there has been limited examination regarding the policies themselves and the corresponding toll exacted upon frontline employees (FLEs) and their managers (FLMs). Thus, this phenomenon warranted an in-depth, multi-method investigation, including a full-scale qualitative exploration substantiated and extended via three experiments and a survey. The qualitative approach probes employees\u2019 feelings about and identifies categories of CDB in retail service settings as well as develops a novel typology of guardianship policies (policy type x approach style). The subsequent studies empirically test the CDB guardianship typology in the context of a particularly detrimental type of CDB\u2014shoplifting, while advancing understanding of firm-related (guardianship expectations), employee-related (trait anxiety) and job role-related (FLE vs FLM) contextual factors impacting perceptions of policy fairness and turnover intentions. The findings provide rich insights for practitioners and scholars by offering a novel guardianship typology and an extensive agenda for future research.\n",

        "abstract": "This article presents a research model that defines how external drivers impact financial performance outcomes, and the role played by strategic practices (especially CSR) in reducing the negative impact of such external influences. Applying strategic orientation theory, risk management theory, and CSR theory as the encompassing theoretical rationale, the conceptual framework defines the research idea and the research model provides the empirically testable model that identifies key variables with valid instrument measures. The results indicate that although external supply chain risk drivers do negatively impact a firm\u2019s financial performance, the influence of these risk events can be mitigated if firms adopt focused strategic practices. The results highlight the significant role played by CSR strategic practices in enabling firms to develop resilience from disruption events. In our research model, CSR, as an organizational linkage practice, is positioned in between upfront strategic flow and back-end performance flow. It suggests that CSR success is only possible when CSR is implemented broadly throughout organizational processes. Based on the empirical results, lessons and implications are presented for theoretical and managerial insights and future research.\n",

        "abstract": "Life 24\u00d7 a Second: Cinema, Selfhood, and Society is about the life-sustaining and life-affirming power of cinema. In confronting the devastating reality of the COVID-19 pandemic, the obligation to explain the value of all artistic expression and pedagogical practice has surely never been greater. This book adopts multiple perspectives on why films matter within and beyond the classroom, with special attention to hearing the sound tracks that move through bodies and that can be carried into the world at large. Drawing on work by authors across disparate fields of literature, business, psychology, biological science, autobiography, history, and cultural studies, this book makes the case for cinema as a life force on the biggest emotional, personal, and social terms, and in ways that can resonate for any reader. The book zeroes in on cinema that offers hope in relation to the Black Lives Matter movement (Imitation of Life (1959) and BlacKkKlansman (2018)); contemporary feminism (Nobody Knows (2004)); the teachings of Heartmath (Dancer in the Dark (2000)); realities of grief and mourning (Life of Pi (2012), Ikiru (1952), and A Star Is Born (2018)); and personal experiences of loss (Call Me By Your Name (2017) and Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019)). Life 24\u00d7 a Second: Cinema, Selfhood, and Society draws directly upon many pedagogical experiences and students\u2019 reflections to show how these films can create a better world for all.\n",

This current study explores how older gay men living with HIV attribute their healthcare experiences to their social identities. Using HCST as a guiding framework, a content and structural coding analysis was conducted on transcripts from 11 interviews of older gay men living with HIV. The majority of HCST experiences were connected to the social identities of sexual orientation, HIV status, and age. Many of the healthcare experiences that participants discussed were related to interactions with healthcare providers and the attitudes of healthcare providers. This study illustrates how participants attributed social identities to healthcare experiences that showed qualities of HCST. These outcomes highlight how marginalized social identities impacted the lifetime healthcare experiences of this group of older gay men living with HIV.\n",

        "abstract": "Blending narrative portraiture and feminist methods, this study explored the lives of two rural women who are creative writers. The study asked (1) What are their critical purposes? and (2) How did gender and place intersect in their writing lives? The findings were that the women used creative writing to engage in praxis by creating and disseminating knowledge. Their writing critically interrogated and redefined conceptions of womanhood. Additional critical purposes were unique to women's intersectional identities and lived experiences. They ranged from interrogating societal perspectives of gender, sexuality, and race to interrogating rurality and sexual violence. The aesthetic texts they created articulated and advocated for intersubjective truths. Shifting the focus of critical literacy from pedagogy and reading to writing beyond educational spaces, the women drew upon critical literacy not as a means of being taught how to understand the power of texts, but to wield the power of texts themselves.\n",

        "abstract": "The zygomatic root, along with other key craniofacial features, is hypothesized to play a crucial role in strengthening the face in response to stresses and strains related to feeding. As such, it has been cited as indicative of dietary specialization among fossil taxa, although it remains unknown how variable zygomatic arch root position is among living primates, and whether its positioning predicts differences in diet. We test whether primates that consume more mechanically challenging foods possess more anteriorly positioned zygomatic roots compared to those consuming less challenging foods. Zygomatic root position, as defined by the zygomaxillare landmark, was identified and recorded from digital images and physical specimens of adult primate crania. Data were collected from 33 haplorhine species (n=\u2009722). Published data were used to assign species to a dietary type based on patterns of overall consumption along with reliance on especially challenging foods. Pairwise comparisons between mechanically challenging (hard and/or tough) and less mechanically challenging (soft) consumers found significant differences (p<\u20090.05) in the position of the zygomatic root in 17 of 20 pairs, 11 of which supported the prediction that a more mechanically challenging diet is associated with a more anteriorly placed zygomatic root. PGLS analysis found no significant effect of phylogeny on root position. This suggests that a more anteriorly positioned zygomatic root is useful for identifying dietary specialization in some taxa but is not required for consuming a mechanically challenging diet given that other craniofacial and behavioral factors can facilitate the consumption of such foods.\n",

        "abstract": "E\u2010petitions have evoked an important debate about the potential for digital activism to pressure firms to change social policies and practices. One prevailing perspective is that slacktivism, a tendency of online supporters to provide only token support, undermines any possible impact. An alternative perspective is that social media dynamics underlying digital activism offer new pathways for social activists to pressure firms toward social change. To explore this debate, we combine insights from research on social movements, social media, and the logic of connective action to theorize the impact of social media mechanisms such as e\u2010petition connectivity and velocity. With a hand\u2010coded database of 1587 e\u2010petitions targeting Fortune 500 firms from 2012 to 2017 through the platformChange.org, we empirically evaluate whether these e\u2010petitions matter. Our empirical results strongly suggest that e\u2010petitions do matter, and we explain when digital activism has impact. The activation of social media mechanisms spreads negative information and directly intensifies the threat to the targeted firm's reputation, pressuring firms to concede to e\u2010petitioner demands. Furthermore, our findings indicate that firm visibility and resource availability can represent boundary conditions for the firm's vulnerability and ability to respond to digital activism.\n",

        "abstract": "## Introduction:\nPeriprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after total hip and total knee arthroplasty is a devastating complication that is known to be associated with costly, resource-intensive interventions that place a significant burden on the US healthcare system. Estimated average hospital costs to treat female patients with PJI after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA) in 2018 was $27,307, and $32,956 respectively. While the average costs to treat male patients with PJI after TKA or THA was $27,097 and $33,090 respectively. One strategy aimed at preventing PJI after total joint arthroplasty is the use of an intra-operative wound irrigation with an antiseptic solution. This retrospective case review was conducted to assess the incidence of PJI after using a novel wound antiseptic irrigation solution in patients undergoing primary TKA and THA.\n\n## Methods:\nThe CDC defines surgical site infections, (SSI) as infections that occur after the surgery. The infections are further categorized as superficial involving the skin, or deep tissue. These infections are then divided into; superficial incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI, and organ-space SSI. In a study by Kannan et al., SSIs are more commonly seen in patients with more comorbidities. A consecutive series of 308 high-risk patients undergoing primary TKA or THA between January 4, 2021 and August 30, 2021, in whom Prontosan\u00ae Wound Irrigation Solution (B. Braun Medical Inc./ Innovice LLC), containing 0.1% Betaine, a surfactant, and 0.1% Polyhexanide (PHMB) was added to the intra-operative procedure, were evaluated for its impact on the incidence of PJI. The CDC\u2019s Surgical Care Improvement Project, (SCIP) guidelines are standard of care and followed with each surgical procedure. The CDC recommends using antimicrobial prophylaxis at a time before skin incision such that the antibiotic concentration reaches the minimum bactericidal concentration at the time of skin incision, Berr\u00edos-Torres SI, et al.\u00a0All data were prospectively submitted to the American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR) was retrospectively analyzed to measure the incidence of postoperative infection.\n\n## Results:\nPrimary TJA was performed on 308 patients; of these 10 patients were bilateral TKA (205 TKA procedures and 113 THA procedures). The use of Prontosan\u00ae Wound Irrigation Solution was associated with zero (0%) incidence of postoperative infection in this population of patients during a 90-day episode of care, nor at any time postoperatively. CMS defines total joint arthroplasty codes as a major surgery, and encounters or procedures within 90 days of the initiating procedure are included in the 90-day episode of care. No patients were lost to follow-up.\n\n## Conclusion:\nThere was no incidence of PJI uncovered in this retrospective analysis. Adding Prontosan\u00ae Wound Irrigation Solution to the intra-operative protocol, contributed to the absence of PJI in this population and potentially avoided 1.74 female and 1.34 male TKA as well as .95 female and .75 THA resulting in total hospital-avoided costs of $83,824 and $56,126, respectively totaling $139,950.\n",

        "abstract": "Our previous study discovered that two urban pest ants, red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), and ghost ants, Tapinoma melanocephalum (Fabricius) (Formicidae: Dolichoderinae), can pave viscose surfaces with particles to facilitate food search and transport. We hypothesize that this paving behavior can be applied to monitor S. invicta and T. melanocephalum. In the present study, 3998 adhesive tapes, each with a food source (sausage), were placed in 20 locations around Guangzhou, China (181\u2013224 tapes per location), and their efficiency to detect S. invicta and T. melanocephalum was compared with two traditional ant-monitoring methods, baiting and pitfall trapping. Overall, S. invicta was detected by 45.6% and 46.4% of baits and adhesive tapes, respectively. In each location, the percentage of adhesive tapes detecting S. invicta and T. melanocephalum was similar when compared to baits and pitfall traps. However, significantly more non-target ant species showed up on bait and pitfall traps. Seven non-target ant species\u2014Pheidole parva Mayr (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Pheidole nodus Smith (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Pheidole sinica Wu & Wang (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Pheidole yeensis Forel (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Carebara affinis (Jerdon) (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Camponotus nicobarensis Mayr (Formicidae: Formicinae), and Odontoponera transversa (Smith) (Formicidae: Ponerinae)\u2014also showed tape paving behavior, but they can be easily distinguished morphologically from S. invicta and T. melanocephalum. Our study showed that the paving behavior occurs in different subfamilies of ants (i.e., myrmicinae, dolichoderinae, formicinae, and ponerinae). In addition, paving behavior can potentially be used to develop more specific monitoring methods for S. invicta and T. melanocephalum in urban areas in southern China.\n",

        "abstract": "Past experiences influence choices, and people's preferences for more similar (habit\u2010forming) or different (variety\u2010seeking) experiences are reflected in these choices. We develop a structural estimation framework to capture whether people are habit forming or variety seeking and apply it to the choice of recreation site. This research contributes to the revealed preference literature by demonstrating how to account for habit or variety\u2010seeking behavior in recreation site choice models in a two\u2010stage framework. Using this framework, we estimate similarity weights that reflect the birders habit formation and variety seeking preferences. Predicted probabilities from the first stage model are then incorporated into the second stage, a mixed logit recreation site choice model of bird watching trips from eBird, by their members. We find that including the dynamic elements of choice, specifically variety\u2010seeking behavior, can double the estimated willingness to pay (WTP) for individual sites relative to the static model. Although our sample of bird watching trips taken by eBird members is a sample of convenience, these results suggest that static models of recreation site choice are a lower bound on our recreation demand WTP estimates. We find variety\u2010seeking preferences are related to land cover and the site's fixed attributes, whereas habit formation appears for seasonality in the bird watching context.\n",

        "abstract": "As both public health and public libraries continue to evolve, there are opportunities for collaboration focused on building policies, systems, and environments that support communities making healthy choices easy choices. Given the health disparities related to physical inactivity, such as diabetes and heart disease in rural America, public libraries within rural communities are emerging as important settings for health promotion and disease prevention. This study sought to better understand how rural libraries promote physical activity opportunities on Facebook. Based on a content analysis of Facebook posts of a random sample of 118 libraries made during the Summer of 2022, 47 of the 118 had at least one post related to physical activity and 42 had multiple posts. The most frequent offering was events or classes; libraries also supported physical activity by lending equipment and making changes to the built environment. This study provides evidence that some rural libraries are offering physical activity opportunities through community health partnerships, particularly for youth and families. Considering this evidence, public health professionals are encouraged to collaborate with local libraries to promote physical activity and advance rural health equity. Researchers are invited to continue to develop the evidence base around promoting physical activity with rural libraries.\n",

Since the formation of the American Psychological Association Division 27: Community Psychology in 1966, now SCRA, 54 people have served in the Presidential role. Presidential leaders' annual addresses both reflect the current state of the field and have the ability to shape the future of both SCRA as an organization and community psychology as a discipline given their positions as leaders. This commentary explores the trajectory of SCRA as an organization via 33 available presidential addresses, 28 of which were published in theAmerican Journal of Community Psychology(AJCP). Using thematic analysis and drawing on both dialectical and life cycle organizational processes, three periods of SCRA and community psychology more broadly were identified:defining community psychology,applying community psychology, andre\u2010imagining community psychology. Themes speak to tensions between the ideals of the society and the work of the society. We conclude by offering a series of questions for consideration as SCRA positions itself for the future.\n",

        "abstract": "The automobile consumption credit business promotes the development of the automobile industry. However, the current credit system in China requires further refinement. Thus, the credit loan business is associated with certain risks, and company profits are often negatively impacted by clients who default on loans. Based on the data, this article leverages the economic and financial theories of consumer credit risk control to construct a logistic model to predict customers' default probability. Then, a quadratic regression model is established to determine the optimal commission structure to balance profitability with incentives from retail stores. Results show that the macro-level variables are negatively associated with the probability of good behavior. The personal level variables exhibit a positive association. In addition, a negative coefficient in the quadratic profit equation indicates the presence of an inverted \u201cU\u201d relationship between profit and commission. Corresponding suggestions are put forward.\n",

        "abstract": "Replication protein A (RPA) is a eukaryotic single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding (SSB) protein that is essential for all aspects of genome maintenance. RPA binds ssDNA with high affinity but can also diffuse along ssDNA. By itself, RPA is capable of transiently disrupting short regions of duplex DNA by diffusing from a ssDNA that flanks the duplex DNA. Using single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence and optical trapping combined with fluorescence approaches, we show thatS. cerevisiaePif1 can use its ATP-dependent 5\u2032\u00a0to 3\u2032 translocase activity to chemomechanically push a single human RPA (hRPA) heterotrimer directionally along ssDNA at rates comparable to those of Pif1 translocation alone. We further show that using its translocation activity, Pif1 can push hRPA from a ssDNA loading site into a duplex DNA causing stable disruption of at least 9 bp of duplex DNA. These results highlight the dynamic nature of hRPA enabling it to be readily reorganized even when bound tightly to ssDNA and demonstrate a mechanism by which directional DNA unwinding can be achieved through the combined action of a ssDNA translocase that pushes an SSB protein. These results highlight the two basic requirements for any processive DNA helicase: transient DNA base pair melting (supplied by hRPA) and ATP-dependent directional ssDNA translocation (supplied by Pif1) and that these functions can be unlinked by using two separate proteins.\n",

        "abstract": "In this study we consider corporate political contributions as a special type of social capital reserved for future contingencies. Firms benefit from making such contributions when the government suddenly intervenes in the market. We explore this value-creation mechanism in terms of the firm-investor relationship, not in terms of the traditional firm-government relationship. When a government intervention is being proposed or approved, firms that have made political contributions coordinating with political candidates are likely to enjoy better stock market returns than those that have not made such contributions. We also argue that firms that have made political contributions may experience lower stock returns than those that have not when the intervention plan is rejected. By focusing on the U.S. government\u2019s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) of 2008, our event study analysis with three news announcements finds that financial institutions that made political action committee (PAC) contributions indeed enjoyed higher stock returns when TARP was proposed and eventually approved. However, we do not find support for the investors\u2019 devaluation of political contributions when TARP was once rejected during the review process. The findings propose that managers can use corporate political contributions as a strategic option to help investors reduce investment uncertainty by presenting their readiness for any unexpected change in the regulatory environment.\n",

        "abstract": "Handedness is a fundamental human trait, although recent research, especially on nonhuman primates, has shown that it is displayed by other animals as well (e.g., chimpanzees, gorillas). In this study, we explore hand preference in wild crab\u2010eating tufted capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus) inhabiting a mangrove forest located on the coastal area of Northeast Brazil (Maranh\u00e3o State). Tufted capuchin monkeys at our site use facultatively wooden tools to crack open crabs. We observed hand preference in 12 subjects who spontaneously participated in experiment sessions, in which we provided crabs and tools on wooden platforms. We recorded (using events and bouts) two unimanual tasks, (tool or crab) grabbing and (tool or crab) pounding, and one bimanual task, crab pulling, where one hand kept the crab in place while the other pulled off parts of the crab. Hand preference increased with greater strength needed to perform the task and its complexity. While only 17%\u221225% of capuchins showed hand preference during grabbing, 44%\u221264% showed hand preference during pounding, and most subjects 64%\u221280% displayed a right\u2010hand preference when performing the bimanual task, for which all lateralized individuals were right\u2010handed. Hand preference did not vary between adults and juvenile individuals and was not consistent across tasks. Group\u2010level hand preference was found only for the bimanual task, for which all lateralized individuals were right\u2010handed. Our findings are in concordance with those of other primate studies showing the emergence of hemispheric specialization for bimanual actions, highlight the importance of conducting such studies on diverse type of tasks, and show the feasibility to conduct experimental manipulation under natural conditions.\n",

        "abstract": "## Background:\nThis study examined the trends and patterns of opioid and non-opioid pharmacotherapy use among a large national sample of privately insured pediatric patients with cancer in the United States.\n\n## Materials and Methods:\nWe identified pediatric (aged\u2005&lt;\u200521) patients diagnosed with central nervous system (CNS), lymphoma, gonadal, leukemia, or bone cancer from MarketScan data 2005-2019. We examined the proportion of patients who filled a prescription for the following 5 types of pharmacotherapy: opioid, anticonvulsant, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), antidepressant, and muscle relaxant during active cancer treatment. We assessed the trends and patterns in pharmacotherapy using multivariable logistic regressions.\n\n## Results:\nAmong 4174 patients included, 2979 (71%) had an opioid prescription; 746 (18%), 384 (9%), 202 (5%), and 169 (4%) had anticonvulsant, NSAID, antidepressant and muscle relaxant prescriptions, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression showed a nonlinear trend in the use of opioids among pediatric patients with cancer over time such that use slightly increased until 2012 (OR of 1.40 [95% CI, 1.12-1.73] for 2012 vs. 2006) but then decreased thereafter (OR of 0.51 [0.37-0.68] for 2018 vs. 2012). The use of anticonvulsants, NSAIDs, and muscle relaxants increased significantly linearly over time (all P\u2005&lt;\u2005.005).\n\n## Conclusion:\nThere has been a downward trend in the use of opioids in recent years among pediatric patients with cancer and an upward trend in the use of non-opioid pharmacotherapy for pain management potentially as an alternative to opioids.\n",

        "abstract": "While nest usurpation and subsequent incubation of eggs and even brooding of chicks from other species has been reported for Common Terns (Sterna hirundo), such behavior is considered rare. We report an observation of a Common Tern pair usurping the Least Tern (Sternula antillarum) nest and brooding the Least Tern chicks. While the Least Tern pair attempted to provide care for the chicks, the Common Terns displayed aggressive behavior and defended the nest. Though both species attempted to feed the chicks, no feeding events were observed due to harassment from the other species. Neither pair was observed nesting prior to or following this event, and all chicks are believed to have been lost to predation. We discuss the possible scenarios leading to the observed usurpation event, the possibility that usurpations are more common than previously believed, and the need for different monitoring methods to elucidate the causes of usurpations.\n",

        "abstract": "Climate change and land\u2010use change are leading drivers of biodiversity decline, affecting demographic parameters that are important for population persistence. For example, scientists have speculated for decades that climate change may skew adult sex ratios in taxa that express temperature\u2010dependent sex determination (TSD), but limited evidence exists that this phenomenon is occurring in natural settings. For species that are vulnerable to anthropogenic land\u2010use practices, differential mortality among sexes may also skew sex ratios. We sampled the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), a freshwater species with TSD, across a large portion of its geographic range (Florida to Maine), to assess the environmental factors influencing adult sex ratios. We present evidence that suggests recent climate change has potentially skewed the adult sex ratio of spotted turtles, with samples following a pattern of increased proportions of females concomitant with warming trends, but only within the warmer areas sampled. At intermediate temperatures, there was no relationship with climate, while in the cooler areas we found the opposite pattern, with samples becoming more male biased with increasing temperatures. These patterns might be explained in part by variation in relative adaptive capacity via phenotypic plasticity in nest site selection. Our findings also suggest that spotted turtles have a context\u2010dependent and multi\u2010scale relationship with land use. We observed a negative relationship between male proportion and the amount of crop cover (within 300\u2009m) when wetlands were less spatially aggregated. However, when wetlands were aggregated, sex ratios remained consistent. This pattern may reflect sex\u2010specific patterns in movement that render males more vulnerable to mortality from agricultural machinery and other threats. Our findings highlight the complexity of species' responses to both climate change and land use, and emphasize the role that landscape structure can play in shaping wildlife population demographics.\n",

        "abstract": "Climate change models often assume similar responses to temperatures across the range of a species, but local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity can lead plants and animals to respond differently to temperature in different parts of their range. To date, there have been few tests of this assumption at the scale of continents, so it is unclear if this is a large\u2010scale problem. Here, we examined the assumption that insect taxa show similar responses to temperature at 96 sites in grassy habitats across North America. We sampled insects with Malaise traps during 2019\u20132021 (N=\u20091041 samples) and examined the biomass of insects in relation to temperature and time of season. Our samples mostly contained Diptera (33%), Lepidoptera (19%), Hymenoptera (18%), and Coleoptera (10%). We found strong regional differences in the phenology of insects and their response to temperature, even within the same taxonomic group, habitat type, and time of season. For example, the biomass of nematoceran flies increased across the season in the central part of the continent, but it only showed a small increase in the Northeast and a seasonal decline in the Southeast and West. At a smaller scale, insect biomass at different traps operating on the same days was correlated up to ~75\u2009km apart. Large\u2010scale geographic and phenological variation in insect biomass and abundance has not been studied well, and it is a major source of controversy in previous analyses of insect declines that have aggregated studies from different locations and time periods. Our study illustrates that large\u2010scale predictions about changes in insect populations, and their causes, will need to incorporate regional and taxonomic differences in the response to temperature.\n",

        "abstract": "RNA\u2010protein aggregates akin to membraneless organelles in modern biology offer a potential model for protocells and precursors to protocells in the chemistry of early Earth. In this project, we explore the aggregation properties of nucleic acids and their nucleotide monomers under a variety of conditions using a fluorescence dye\u2010based assay for aggregation. The building blocks of RNA \u2013 guanosine monophosphate and adenosine monophosphate showed intrinsic concentration\u2010dependent aggregation. Cyclic incubation between high and low temperatures, mimicking for example conditions around a hydrothermal vent, increased aggregation. This trend was enhanced when experiments were repeated with total RNA extracted from bacterial and fungal sources. RNA aggregation was further enhanced by the incorporation of peptides featuring an RNA binding sequence combined with an intrinsically disordered region. Our results show that RNA aggregation, a key first step on the pathway to protocells, can be enhanced through temperature cycling and the binding of short disordered peptides.\n",

        "abstract": "By 2050 there could be around 12 billion tons of plastic in landfills and the natural environment, which could be avoided by using a more environmentally friendly alternative: biologically produced plastic, or bioplastic. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a bioplastic whose precursor is an intermediate in the ethylmalonyl\u2010CoA pathway (EMCP), a pathway for acetyl\u2010CoA assimilation in bacteria. The genes that encode the enzymes for two different acetyl\u2010CoA assimilation pathways, the glyoxylate bypass (GB) and the EMCP, have been observed in two PHB\u2010producing bacteria:Rhodobacter capsulatusandParacoccus denitrificans. It was previously observed thatP. denitrificansasynchronously uses both pathways when grown with acetate. We producedR. capsulatusfusion strains by fusing the gene for a fluorescent protein, mCherry, to the gene of a key enzyme of the EMCP or GB and observed the fluorescence during growth with acetate. Tracking fluorescence allowed us to track the accumulation of each key enzyme, which indirectly indicates the activity of the pathway. We observed that unlikeP. denitrificans, the GB inR. capsulatusis not essential to growth with acetate. Understanding the use/occurrence of the EMCP in bacteria is a step to being able to manipulate the EMCP to produce commercially relevant levels of bioplastic and related products.\n",

        "abstract": "Honey bees are important for crop and wild flower pollination and are facing population decline due to several factors that may be mitigated through conservation efforts. The purpose of this study was to assess attitudes towards honey bees of adults visiting a honey bee information table at a University's weeklong pollinator event in the spring of 2019. Attitudes were assessed utilizing 12 statements scored on a 5-point Likert scale of strongly agree to strongly disagree. Relationships between demographics and attitudes were explored using chi-square test and Bonferroni correction. Attitudes towards honey bees were, overall, positive. Participants recognize the intelligence of honey bees and agree it is important to learn about honey bees, protect them, and that they are an important part of the environment. They disagreed that they felt fear when near a honey bee, and disagreed that it is better to kill a bee than be stung. Additionally, they disagreed that they would kill a honey bee found in their home. Participants strongly disagreed that honey bees are dangerous. Significant relationships were found between number of times a person was stung and attitudes towards learning about honey bees and whether a person felt that killing a honey bee is better than being stung. A significant relationship was also found between geographic location and importance of honey bees to the environment. This study highlighted the need to continue education and exposure of the public to honey bees in order to positively affect perceptions.\n",

Effect of an 11-week resistance training program on arterial stiffness in young women.J Strength Cond Res37(2): 315\u2013321, 2023\u2014The current investigation was conducted to determine the effect of 2 resistance training models on indices of arterial stiffness in young, healthy women. Twenty-four women, untrained college students, aged 18\u201322 years were randomized into 1 of 3 groups: control (CON) group (n= 8), high-intensity (HI) resistance exercise group (n= 8), and high-volume (HV) resistance exercise group (n= 8). Subjects randomized to resistance training groups were required to perform strength training exercises 3\u20135 days a week for 11 weeks. The exercise regimen consisted of 2\u20133 sets of 3\u20138 repetitions (80\u201390% of 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) for the HI group and 3\u20134 sets of 10\u201315 repetitions (50\u201370% of 1RM) for the HV group. All subjects were instructed to continue their normal diet and avoid cardiovascular exercise during the study. After the intervention, there was a significant increase in carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) (6.39 \u00b1 0.73 to 8.40 \u00b1 2.31 m\u00b7s\u22121;p< 0.05) and carotid radial PWV (9.77 \u00b1 1.74 to 12.58 \u00b1 2.09 m\u00b7s\u22121;p< 0.05) in the CON group alone. Both the HI and HV groups increased their maximum squat (36.6 \u00b1 7.9 vs. 41.3 \u00b1 31.8 percent change;p< 0.05), bench press (34.4 \u00b1 12.6 vs. 23.4 \u00b1 11.1 percent change;p< 0.05), and seated row (22.0 \u00b1 12.6 vs. 21.9 \u00b1 12.5 percent change;p< 0.05), respectively. Our findings support the use of resistance training exercise without undue impact on vascular compliance in otherwise healthy women.\n",

        "abstract": "Established social psychology literature shows that people demonstrate a systematic bias when estimating the proportion of others who hold their viewpoint on a range of issues; the majority regularly underestimates agreement, and the minority shows even greater error in overestimating agreement with their viewpoint. Applying this to climate change may help us better understand the determinants of public opinion on that issue. Across four studies, we found that people who believe climate change is happening (the majority) underestimate the percentage of other people who hold their view, whereas those who do not believe climate change is happening (the minority) greatly overestimate agreement with their view. We consistently found this pattern for other contemporary issues where there was a clear majority/minority distinction. Furthermore, greater certainty of one's position on climate change was related to greater and more accurate estimates of agreement among the majority, whereas low certainty was associated with estimates closer to 50%. Consistent with cognitive availability as a mechanism for these findings, exploratory analyses suggest that greater certainty of climate change happening is associated with a greater subjective knowledge and frequency of thinking and hearing about climate change, and talking about it with others. Finding the majority/minority pattern of consensus bias for climate change and other issues suggests that general approaches, such as providing accurate normative data and targeting efforts according to a population's belief certainty, may impact public sentiment and engagement on climate change.\n",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic forced many public health professionals to take on new roles such as online teaching, communicating, and managing; serving on the frontlines of patient care; and serving as health education resource personnel. Researchers of this study posed the question: How has the pandemic impacted those who serve to help others? Seven aspects of self-efficacy in professional practice were examined via an online survey sent to health educators. Respondents were extremely confident communicating with their colleagues and supervisors (60%) and with students (51%), but only 19% were extremely confident in maintaining a work-life balance and 22% in managing personal and professional stress. Respondents reported being confident in all areas of responsibilities, overall, but they were most confident in Area 8 (ethics and professionalism) and least confident in Area 1 (assessing the needs and capacity of a community) since COVID-19. Findings imply a need for more professional development opportunities to foster professional and personal self-efficacy and to improve self-efficacy in needs assessment, leadership, and advocacy. Findings also show a need for workplace or state-based interventions to support resiliency and self-care among professionals who work to serve others.\n",

        "abstract": "Youth-led participatory action research (YPAR) is an applied research methodology in which youth work in collaboration with adult stakeholders to conduct research projects. YPAR has been traditionally conducted in person, with virtual forums typically serving as ways to share resources and ideas across independent YPAR teams or collecting data. The COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the closure of most public spaces where youth congregate (including schools) and requirements to socially distance, led to translating YPAR projects into completely virtual formats. This paper aims to provide promises and challenges of conducting virtual YPAR during the COVID-19 pandemic. It describes how a team of university faculty, college students, and youth from two community-based youth organizations navigated a YPAR experience during the 2020-2021 academic year. We provide reflections on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on (a) the research setting, (b) the building of collaborative relationships, (c) YPAR methodology, (d) youth engagement, and (e) conceptualization of community action and engagement. We end with the implications for the future of YPAR for practitioners.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nAdvancing technology and increasing demand for contactless purchase methods have encouraged retailers to integrate technology into the point-of sale experience. However, limited research explores how consumers perceive contactless payment technology compared with traditional payment methods. Two experiments demonstrate that contactless payment methods, when compared with traditional, contact forms of payments such as cash and credit card transactions, are perceived as less contaminated. Additionally, consumers using contactless payment technology hold more favorable attitudes toward the retailer. However, the benefits derived from using contactless payments are negated for retailers whose customers expect to use contaminated methods of payment, such as cash.\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nWellness behaviors enacted during the college years may have long-term impacts on adult health; as such, it is critical that college students be educated regarding health behaviors and ways to improve their wellness. One way to educate students in reference to improved health practices is through college/university instructional physical activity programs that include a didactic wellness component. Limited research is available on the impact that courses of this nature have on student wellness outcomes. To assess the impact of a 15-week fitness and wellness course on perceived wellness in emerging adults, a convenience sample of undergraduate students (N = 334) enrolled in a general education Lifelong Fitness and Wellness class completed an instrument consisting of the Perceived Wellness Survey (PWS), the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-3), and demographic questions at the beginning and end of the Fall 2018 semester. Data were collected using a web-based survey administered through a password-protected Qualtrics account. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the goodness of fit of participants\u2019 responses on the PWS to the proposed model and then the data were analyzed using a pretest/posttest statistical design. Mixed analyses of covariance revealed improvements in overall wellness, emotional wellness, and physical wellness from pretest to posttest with no impact on lecture delivery mode or activity participation type. These results indicate that general wellness and fitness courses may positively impact perceived wellness in college students.\n\nKEYWORDS: Physical activity, wellness, young adults\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\n",

        "abstract": "The growing human population is responsible for a massive decline in species, biodiversity, and ecosystems across the globe. If we are to significantly slow these losses, the attention and resources devoted to individual causes should be commensurate with the magnitude of their contribution to the problem. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative magnitude of five major threats to species identified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as threatened with extinction. Specifically, we analyzed the entire IUCN Red List database to determine the percentage of threatened species affected by overexploitation, climate change, pollution, habitat destruction, and invasive species, diseases, and genes. We also randomly sampled a portion of the database to estimate the percentage of species for which each threat was the dominant threat placing them at risk of extinction. Of the 20,784 species for which data were available, 88.3% were impacted by habitat destruction, 26.6% by overexploitation, 25% by invasives, 18.2% by pollution, and 16.8% by climate change and weather. Focusing on dominant threats, the percentage of species for which a given threat was the main factor pushing them toward extinction was as follows: habitat destruction 71.3%, overexploitation 7.4%, invasives 6.8%, pollution 4.7%, climate change, and weather 1.8%. Regardless of how percentages are calculated, habitat destruction threatens more species than all other categories combined, climate change the fewest. From the perspective of species and biodiversity conservation, these data suggest that a significant change in global environmental priorities is needed. Habitat destruction should become a greater focus of global environmental efforts and receive the attention and resources appropriate to the extraordinary magnitude of its impact. Moreover, while it is important to address all environmental problems, given the disproportionate impact habitat destruction has on species, care should be taken to avoid solutions to other problems that exacerbate this destruction.\n",

Surveys were conducted at three study sites with abundant Symplocos tinctoria (L.) L'H\u00e9r. (Family: Symplocaceae), the caterpillar host plant. We found caterpillars at only one site using UV LED flashlights and adults at two of the three sites. Mating was not observed, and eggs were not found. We discuss observations of S. kingi adults and caterpillars, management of our study sites, data from habitat assessments, and recommendations for further study of S. kingi.\n",

        "abstract": "Due to systemic racialized homophobia and transphobia, Black lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer\u00a0(LGBTQ+) people continue to experience worse life outcomes in comparison to both their Black cisgender and heterosexual, and White LGBTQ+\u00a0counterparts. Community psychologists have the tools and training to address these disparities. Using a critical whiteness studies lens, we draw on qualitative data with 17 White LGBTQ+\u00a0people to describe how white supremacy manifests in LGBTQ+\u00a0spaces. Our research indicates White LGBTQ+\u00a0people want to create intersectional spaces but lack the necessary skills to effectively confront anti\u2010Black racism. This resulted in actions which upheld and reinforced white supremacy, despite stated commitments to Black LGBTQ+\u00a0liberation. We conclude with recommendations for community psychologists, including engaging in intersectional coalition\u2010building, training centered around queer critical race theory, working to address racialized homophobia and transphobia alongside existing efforts to deconstruct anti\u2010Black racism within community psychology, and consciousness\u2010raising work with White people involved in LGBTQ+\u00a0equality movements to dismantle white supremacist structures within their organizations.\n",

The dramatic decline of this species heightens the significance of new occurrences outside the known range. Herein we report the first ever capture and genetic confirmation of an adult male Northern Long-eared Bat on the Delmarva Peninsula, MD, located on the northern portion of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. This finding suggests further surveys are needed along the Atlantic Coastal Plain to determine if this region is being increasingly utilized by this species in the era of WNS.\n",

Indeed, due to the global pandemic, physical activity has been reduced by 32.3% among previously active participants. Regular exercise is an effective way to maintain health and also results in various physiological adaptations in the neuromuscular and cardiovascular systems, which lead to improved physical performance.\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a functional training program, delivered via Zoom, on the neuromuscular system as well as resting blood pressure measures.\nMETHODS: Fifteen participants were assigned to either exercise (M = 4; F = 5) or control (M = 3; F = 3) group. The 4-week bodyweight circuit exercise protocol (i.e., jumping jacks; modified push-ups; high knees; squat; mountain climbers; and lunges) was performed 3d/wk for four weeks. Maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) were performed using a handgrip dynamometer. During each contraction, surface electromyography (sEMG) and force signals were recorded to assess sEMG amplitude (RMS) of flexor carpi radialis muscle as well as peak force (PF). Additionally, the brachial artery's resting blood pressure (BP) in a fasted state was recorded before and after the 4-week intervention. BP was self-monitored by participants once a day for 4 weeks to evaluate systolic and diastolic pressure readings. Two-way ANOVAs with factors of group [i.e., home-based exercise (HBE); control (CON)] and time [i.e., pre-post] were used to analyze pre- and post-testing measures.\nRESULTS: No significant (p > 0.05) differences between groups were observed in resting BP and sEMG-RMS. However, the HBE group significantly (p < 0.05) increased MVIC of the right hand (HBE: 27.8 \u00b1 5.1 to 31.2 \u00b1 5.2 kg, CON: 26.0 \u00b1 2.3 to 25.6 \u00b1 2.6 kg) from pre- to post-testing.\nCONCLUSION: Despite the lack of significant improvements in neural activation and resting blood pressure, the HBE groups significantly improved muscular strength by performing home-based functional circuit workouts. These findings suggest that home-based functional training delivered remotely is an effective strategy to improve muscular strength after four weeks.Copyright \u00a9 2022 by the American College of Sports MedicineView full article text\n",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of state ownership on the efficiency-equality tradeoff in a mixed economy with both state and nonstate sectors. Using overall capital productivity as an efficiency proxy and state output share as an inequality proxy, we identify the efficiency threshold of state capital share that splits the efficiency-equality relationship between a tradeoff and nontradeoff. When state capital share is greater than the threshold (as evidenced in the case of China), lowering state capital share improves efficiency and reduces inequality. Furthermore, our simulation results suggest that the threshold is sensitive to capital shares in output of the both sectors. A broad scope for mutual gains in efficiency and\u00a0equality exists by raising the capital share in nonstate output and lowering the capital share in state output.\n",

        "abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) results in degenerating peripheral nerves and affects over 50% of people with diabetes. Despite its high prevalence, DPN\u2019s molecular pathways remain unknown, limiting treatment to pain management. The Clark lab has characterized two novel models of hyperglycemia in zebrafish in which DPN\u2010like phenotypes are recapitulated, including demyelination. In an attempt to elucidate the unknown molecular mechanisms of DPN, candidate small molecule drugs are currently being tested to accentuate or attenuate neurodegeneration. Lavendustin\u2010A, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), was hypothesized to have a neuroprotective role, as overactivation of EGFR in hyperglycemic environments is associated with fibrosis and the inhibition of regeneration in various tissue types.Tg(mbp:gfpcaax)larval zebrafish were incubated in egg water (control 1) or 120mM glucose solution (control 2 and treatment) starting five days post\u2010fertilization (dpf) until 10dpf. From 10\u201012dpf, control 1 remained in egg water + 1% DMSO, control 2 remained in glucose solution + 1% DMSO, and the treatment group remained in glucose solution + 1% DMSO + 65.5\u00b5M Lavendustin\u2010A. 12dpf, lateral images of myelinated (MBP+) peripheral motor nerves were taken on an EVOS imaging system. Fiji (NIH) software was used to measure the length and fluorescent intensity of the myelinated nerves. Both nerve length (*p=0.025) and MBP fluorescent intensity (**p=0.0013) were significantly greater in the treatment group compared to the hyperglycemic fish (control 2), and no significant difference was observed between the treatment group and control 1. To determine if function was impacted, a touch\u2010response assay was conducted before (10dpf) and after (12dpf) drug treatment. Escape response was significantly impaired in hyperglycemic fish (treatment and control 2) at 10dpf (***p=0.0007) and significantly improved in the treatment group by 12dpf (***p=0.0003), yet did not fully recover, as there was still a significant difference between the treatment group and control 1 (**p=0.0017). Our data suggests a possible role of EGFR in hyperglycemia\u2010induced neurodegeneration, getting us one step closer to identifying potential therapeutics for clinical application.\n",

        "abstract": "How German were German anarchists in the United States and Brazil? Did the experience of exile and immigration preserve or even heighten a national identity among radicals who openly espoused revolutionary internationalism? Anarchists distinguished between nation and nationality on the one hand, and the state and nationalism on the other. This article examines expressions of nationality by a handful of German anarchist editors and writers from the 1880s to the end of World War II. They wanted to be stateless, but not nationless. This article argues that German exile anarchists in the United States and Brazil expressed a militant, countercultural, antistatist and anticlerical nationality. They were \u2018rooted cosmopolitans\u2019: They identified with the international revolutionary tradition and at the same time remained attached to Germany's heritage of radical politics, arts and humanities. There was a remarkable consistency in their commentary levelled against Bismarck, the Kaiser, the Weimar government and the Nazis either in Germany or in the host country. Anarchists advocated for a borderless global federation of free communities and, to that end, rejected nationalism and urged people to stop \u2018seeing like a state\u2019 by exposing the false promises and crimes of statism.\n",

When constructed to reflect best practices evidenced in the research literature, micro-credentials and other 21st century innovations provide accessible, meaningful, professional learning experiences for educators. This chapter discusses two cases that affected personal transformation and pedagogical change for in-service teachers by an institution of higher education (IHE). A preliminary analysis of these alternative experiences established that when teacher professional development is founded on the context-sensitive integration of social and cultural competencies, meaningful, empowering, and enduring learning can take place.\n",

        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic condition that can result in numerous comorbidities, including diabetes\u2010induced osteoporosis. Regardless of age, diabetics are at an increased risk of bone fracture as a result of decreased bone quality and mass. In the Clark lab we have previously established a glucose immersion model of hyperglycemic induction in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). Zebrafish are a viable model to study diabetic complications as they glucoregulate similar to mammals and have robust regenerative abilities previously shown to regenerate pancreatic b\u2010cells, peripheral nerves, cardiac muscle, and fins. Given the negative impact diabetes has on bones, we hypothesized that hyperglycemia would negatively impact vertebral development; but given zebrafish\u2019s ability to regenerate we also hypothesized that after a recovery from hyperglycemia, the vertebrae would have a similar phenotype to controls. Larval zebrafish were incubated in 120 mM glucose solution (treatment), or egg water (control), for seven days beginning five days post fertilization (dpf). To assess vertebral development following a recovery period, zebrafish were placed in normal egg water for an additional ten days, and control fish were kept in egg water for an equal amount of time. Using alizarin red to visualize mineralized vertebrae after 7\u2010day incubation in glucose solution (12dpf) showed a reduced percentage of zebrafish with any mineralized vertebrae compared to controls (****p<0.0001). The vertebrae that were present following treatment had significantly less area of mineralized centra compared to controls (****p<0.0001). This suggests that hyperglycemia negatively impacted initial vertebral development. Following recovery (22 dpf), the treatment fish had significantly reduced total body length than controls (****p<0.0001). Treatment fish continued to have significantly less mineralized centra area (****p<0.0001) and significantly increased area of intervertebral domain (****p<0.0001) when compared to size matched controls. This suggests that the vertebrae of treatment fish are mineralizing and expanding into the intervertebral domain at a slower rate than controls. Additionally, glucose\u2010treated fish had significantly reduced percentage of fish with mineralized neural (****p<0.0001) and hemal (****p<0.0001) arches present on their vertebra compared to controls. These results suggest a dramatic impairment of vertebral development that extends beyond both treatment and recovery periods, leading us to believe the reduced mineralization may be responsible for the behavioral deficits through reductions in their ability to swim. Furthermore, our results may indicate profound effects of gestation and childhood diabetes on the skeletal development of children. Future experiments will investigate osteoblast and chondrocyte populations following hyperglycemic induction and recovery to elucidate the mechanisms that result in impaired vertebral mineralization. This discovery would guide further research into potential therapeutics for diabetes\u2010induced osteoporosis.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTAs of 2018, there were more than 44.7 million immigrants residing, both lawfully and unlawfully, in the United States [Batalova, J., Blizzard, B., & Bolter, J. (2020, February 14). Frequently requested statistics on immigrants and immigration in the United States. Migration Policy Institute. https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states]. Understanding the attitudes of U.S. citizens towards immigrants is necessary because of the impact that attitudes can have on policy development and the subsequent national treatment of immigrants based on those policies. This article utilizes a framework of national identity which suggests that this construct is comprised of three separate elements: nativism, emotionality, and behavior. Using U.S. citizen response data from three waves of the National Identity module of the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) from 1995, 2003, and 2013, multivariate linear regressions were used to explore the relationship between this framework and attitudes towards immigrants. Findings indicated that there were statistically significant relationships between respondents\u2019 perceptions of national identity and attitudes towards immigrants.KEYWORDS: National identityimmigration attitudesimmigration policynativismbehavioremotionalityDisclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Additional informationNotes on contributorsAmanda HillDr. Amanda Hill earned her master\u2019s degree in social work from Salisbury University in 2010, and her PhD in social work from Widener University in 2019.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThe intersection of ethics and diversity is central to our profession\u2014yet it remains critically unexamined. This article seeks to fill this gap by suggesting the use of a new ethical deliberation heuristic: intersectional ethics. Grounded in intersectionality as a social theory and anti-oppressive practice, intersectional ethics utilizes six heuristic questions to consider positionality, social identity categories, dominant and non-dominant moral theories, professional mandates, and power. These questions are incremental and cumulative in nature; they are meant to engage and support anti-oppressive ethics, and to promote critical inquiry and reflexivity. Specific recommendations\u2014including modules\u2014are made for integrating the heuristic in social work ethics curriculum.\n\nKEYWORDS: Ethics, diversity, intersectionality, anti-oppressive, reflexivity\n\nAcknowledgment\nThe author wishes to thank Anthony A. Bibus, Professor Emeritus, Augsburg University, Department of Social Work, for his helpful review of the initial manuscript. The author also wishes to thank the reviewers for their helpful feedback.\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nAdditional information\nNotes on contributors\nBibiana D.

This study analyzes candidate announcements from the 2020 Democratic Party nomination for president and how each of the top six candidates branded themselves. The campaign announcement is the first opportunity to shape the brand of the candidate in a crowded field of candidates. Comparisons will be made between candidates with national name recognition and those who have yet to make a name for themselves on a national stage. For more well-known candidates, this address is meant to energize supporters and build momentum toward the nomination. Well-known candidates may be able to more clearly form a branding around policy positions. For the lesser-known candidates, it is a chance to introduce themselves to the nation and begin to build a following. These speakers may present a more personal narrative to brand themselves as an individual before presenting policy. A comparison will also be made between male and female candidates, including an analysis of gendered language in announcing their candidacy.\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article presents some features, potentials, limitations, and bibliographies of the intersection of postcolonialism, postsecularism, and literary studies. It examines literatures, cultures, religions, indigenous beliefs and practices, and political imaginaries from Africa, Europe, and South Asia. The religions discussed include Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism. The article shows how the institutional and discursive emergence of postcolonial postsecularism, including its intersection with literary studies, can draw lessons from similarly contestatory fields of study, such as postcolonial theory, postcolonial feminism, and intersectional feminism. The article includes bibliographies of literary works that address secularism and postsecularism, including their intersection with postcoloniality. KEYWORDS: Postcolonial postsecularism, intersectional feminism, literary studies, Europe, Africa, South Asia.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTCurrently, there is renewed interest in organizations providing greater economic benefits to its members given the widening divide among social classes. A major source of alternatives to capitalist organizations in the U.S. was the co-operative movement sponsored by the Knights of Labor during 1870\u20131889. This study examines cases of the Knights\u2019 producer cooperatives to understand how they functioned and why they failed. The intent of the co-operatives was to restore worker independence and control over their work in the emerging factory system. This study applies core frames of social movements to examine the motivation and processes the Knights used to establish their cooperatives. Micro histories of selected co-ops in three regions of the U.S. were developed from primary research conducted during the 1880s as well as contemporary journals and newspapers. Rather than being radical, the co-operatives were based on American republican ideals, and they borrowed governance structures similar to corporations, both of which contributed to their success. Reasons for the failure of the Knights and their co-ops are examined. The legacy of the Knights\u2019 producer co-ops is discussed along with ideas for future research.\n\nKEYWORDS: Co-operatives, Knights of Labor, labor republicanism, micro histories, social movement analysis\n\nDisclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nCorrection Statement This article has been corrected with minor changes. These changes do not impact the academic content of the article.\n\nNotes 1. The nineteenth century hyphenated spelling of \u2018co-operative\u2019 is used throughout the paper. 2. Early non-labor co-operatives included communities of Robert Owen\u2019s co-operative community in the 1820s and Charles Fourier\u2019s Associationists in the 1840s; see, Wright (Citation2010). 3. The Knights backed Greenback Party sought monetary reform during a recession, but it faded with an upturn in the economy in 1879\u201382, see Curl (2012, pp. 89\u201390). 4. In the 1880s John Bates Clark, an economist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore was interested in the growth of organizations using employee ownership and profit sharing. He divided up the country into five regions and assigned a doctoral student to study the development of these firms in each region. The five researchers (i.e. Edward Bemis, Albert Shaw, Amos Warner, Howard Shinn, and Daniel Randall) conducted onsite visits and interviews with many co-ops in their assigned regions. These studies formed the basis of their dissertations and were eventually published as the History of Co-operation in the United States (1888) which represented Vol. VI in the Johns Hopkins Studies in Historical and Political Science edited by Herbert B. Adams. 5. According to Curl (2012, pp. 88\u201391), by 1872 two-thirds of the employed were estimated to be wage earners. 6. For example, both the National Labor Union and the International Working People\u2019s Association referred to or quoted the Declaration of Independence (Powderly, Citation1889, pp. 81\u201382). 7. The KoL\u2019s first assemblies included sojourners, shipwrights, weavers, and riggers. 8. The great upheaval that resulted in over 100 strikers killed, over 500 wounded and more than 1000 jailed. Hayes use of troops to quell labor unrest was the first such presidential action in the U.S. 9. Powderly had been elected mayor of Scranton, PA, a mining and railroad center, under the Greenback Labor Party; once the party failed, Powderly became disillusioned with a political solution (Dubofsky & McCartin, 2017). 10. Prior to his KoL work, Sharpe had founded a co-operative community in Missouri and in 1884 became the editor of the Co-operative section of the Journal of United Labor. 11. Another poll taken at the General Assembly in 1884 revealed that only 14 members were in favor of a compulsory fee or tax to fund co-ops; thereafter it was left up to local assemblies. 12. In the face of bad harvests and depression, the French King was overthrown, and the Second Republic was established under Louis Napoleon III after a brief worker rebellion in Paris. It established the right to work among other things in France (see Agulhon, Citation1983). 13. Corporations had boards made up of both managers and outside members. The board hired the president who in turn hired other top managers who need not come from within the firm; it was not democratic like the co-ops. Furthermore, shares were sold to outsiders, and votes were based on shares held. Reports to shareholders were provided from one to four times a year. For more on corporate governance of the period see, see for example, Hilt (Citation2015). 14. Massachusetts co-op laws were amended in 1870 and 1879. 15. This proportional share of profits was modeled after the Rochdale distributive co-ops who distributed profits based on value of members\u2019 purchases. This became a common practice in many KoL producer co-ops. 16. In 1869, forty-five artisan coopers were able to make all the oak and elm barrels needed by the flour mills. By the 1870s, the mills produced 10\u201320 long rail trains of product every 24 hours, hence, the growth in cooper co-ops. 17. The article went onto say that co-ops were most successful in New York, the West, and the South but not in New England. 18. During the final decade of the century, the Sherman Act was used to break at least a dozen unions, but not once to break a corporate trust. 19. The use of federally protected Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) developed as part of the Employment Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 made union buyouts feasible, see for example, \u2018New York Times\u2019 (Citation2003).

        "abstract": "Corporations, which in the past have been hesitant to contribute to conversations regarding political and social issues, are increasingly speaking out on current issues such as race, sexual orientation, gender, immigration, and environmental issues. Despite this trend, limited academic research has focused on how corporate sociopolitical activism (CSA) efforts impact firm value. In addition, extant studies have not fully identified the extent to which the firm and their message influence the outcomes of this approach. The current study explores how sociopolitical stances communicated on Twitter affect firms\u2019 stock prices. Results from an event study of 260 incidents of CSA show that CSA efforts decrease firm value by an average of 0.22%, indicating that wading into social or political issues is a risky strategy. However, further analysis highlights the importance of clearly articulating stances on social issues that align with the firm\u2019s core values.\n",

        "abstract": "Females of many species choose mates using multiple sensory modalities. Multimodal noise may arise, however, in dense aggregations of animals communicating via multiple sensory modalities. Some evidence suggests multimodal signals may not always improve receiver decision-making performance. When sensory systems process input from multimodal signal sources, multimodal noise may arise and potentially complicate decision-making due to the demands on cognitive integration tasks. We tested female t\u00fangara frog, Physalaemus (=Engystomops) pustulosus, responses to male mating signals in noise from multiple sensory modalities (acoustic and visual). Noise treatments were partitioned into three categories: acoustic, visual, and multimodal. We used natural calls from conspecifics and heterospecifics for acoustic noise. Robotic frogs were employed as either visual signal components (synchronous vocal sac inflation with call) or visual noise (asynchronous vocal sac inflation with call). Females expressed a preference for the typically more attractive call in the presence of unimodal noise. However, during multimodal signal and noise treatments (robofrogs employed with background noise), females failed to express a preference for the typically attractive call in the presence of conspecific chorus noise. We found that social context and temporal synchrony of multimodal signaling components are important for multimodal communication. Our results demonstrate that multimodal signals have the potential to increase the complexity of the sensory scene and reduce the efficacy of female decision making.\n",

        "abstract": "Amphibious fishes have many adaptations that make them successful in a wide variety of conditions, including air-breathing, terrestrial locomotor capabilities, and extreme tolerance of poor water quality. However, the traits that make them highly adaptable may allow these fishes to successfully establish themselves outside of their native regions. In particular, the terrestrial capabilities of invasive amphibious fishes allow them to disperse overland, unlike fully aquatic invasive fishes, making their management more complicated. Despite numerous amphibious fish introductions around the world, ecological risk assessments and management plans often fail to adequately account for their terrestrial behaviors. In this review, I discuss the diversity of invasive amphibious fishes and what we currently know about why they emerge onto land, how they move around terrestrial environments, and how they orient while on land. In doing so, I use case studies of the performance and motivations of nonnative amphibious fishes in terrestrial environments to propose management solutions that factor in their complete natural history. Amphibious fish species have established a disproportionate number of nonative populations globally compared to fully aquatic species. Because of their terrestrial capabilities, we may need to manage amphibious fishes more like amphibians than fully aquatic fishes, but to do so, we need to learn more about how these species perform in a wide range of terrestrial environments and conditions.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education (JSDSE) has a history of initiatives to expand its readership and impact. In this article, we reflect on JSDSE\u2019s relevance to K-12 education and how it might increase its influence in this area. We characterize JSDSE\u2019s K-12 impact partially in terms of its ability to foster statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT). We also introduce a new construct, statistical knowledge for the transformation of teaching (SKT2), to more fully capture the K-12 contributions JSDSE can make. Our analysis draws upon the perspectives of an experienced high school teacher (the first author) and a statistics education researcher (the second author). The first author of the article surveyed recent JSDSE issues to identify and reflect upon articles with implications for his teaching practice. The second author framed the first author\u2019s article reflections in terms of their connections to SKT and SKT2. Drawing upon our collaborative analysis, we propose strategies to help JSDSE more fully realize its potential to contribute to SKT and SKT2. We explain how acting on the proposed strategies may help JSDSE readers, authors, and editors bridge the persistent historical gap between formal scholarship and practice in K-12 education.\n\nKEYWORDS: Assessment, Curriculum, Education, Pedagogical content knowledge, Professional development, Statistical knowledge for teaching\n\n1  Introduction\nThe Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education (JSDSE) has a long history of making scholarly work accessible to a wide audience. As the journal was founded, Arnold (Citation1993) stated that it was \u201cintended to be international in scope, dedicated to improving all postsecondary statistics education, and crossing both disciplinary and national borders\u201d (n. p.). The intended audience encompassed those teaching \u201cpure\u201d statistics as well as those teaching statistics in various disciplines such as psychology, economics, and biology.\n\nAs the journal grew, efforts to expand its reach grew as well. For example, in 2007, a new department, \u201cFrom Research to Practice,\u201d was established to encourage conversations about using research to inform teaching. The journal\u2019s readers were invited to craft submissions by \u201cfinding a research article of interest, reading and reflecting on it, implementing ideas from the paper in their classes, assessing the results, writing up their findings, and submitting it\u201d (Miller Citation2007, n. p.). Another new department, \u201cResearch on K-12 Statistics Education,\u201d was later established to encourage study of precollege teaching and learning of statistics (Jacobbe Citation2013). Although the journal\u2019s original intended audience was those teaching college-level statistics, it has expanded to include K-12 issues. The journal\u2019s efforts to expand its K-12 content and connect research to practice, along with the fact that it is freely available online, make it a potentially powerful catalyst to help improve K-12 teaching and learning.\n\n2  Purpose\nIn this article, we aim to support JSDSE\u2019s goal of improving K-12 statistics education by reflecting on the journal\u2019s current and potential impact in this area. Our reflections draw upon our backgrounds in K-12 education and statistics education research. The first author of this article is a high school teacher. When the article was written, he had 7 years of teaching experience at a rural high school of approximately 500\u2013600 students and had taught AP Statistics each year to classes ranging between 10 and 25 students in size. He also had served as an official AP Statistics exam scorer. The second author is a university faculty member and researcher in the field of statistics education. He has investigated the nature and importance of statistical knowledge for teaching and has published such work in JSDSE and in other venues. Collectively, our reflections highlight directions JSDSE has taken, and may be able to take in the future, to publish content addressing the needs of K-12 statistics teachers.\n\n3  Method\nA reading response journal (Lee Citation2008) constructed during a 5-week independent study course provided the initial collaboration space for the reflections reported in this article. The second author, who served as course instructor, elicited the first author\u2019s initial impressions of JSDSE by asking him to browse recent volumes of the journal and select articles with relevance to his teaching practice. Each week, the first author selected three articles from a volume of JSDSE published within the past five years, initially attending to articles with value for teaching AP Statistics. As the first author carried out this task, he wrote reflections on how each selected article could inform his practice and uploaded the reflections to an online course management system. The second author then wrote detailed feedback on the first author\u2019s journal entries to prompt additional reflection on implications for statistics education. Providing such feedback on written journal entries can be a powerful technique to foster and deepen reflection (Pieper et al. Citation2021). At the end of each week of the course, the two authors met to discuss the reflections and feedback. These discussions helped identify additional possible implications for teaching AP Statistics and K-12 education in general. A subjectively chosen sample of 15 articles was discussed using this process.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nPre-adolescent transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) youth who are supported by their parents have improved psychosocial outcomes. Despite the important role parents play in TGNC youth\u2019s development, there is little research on their experiences. This study explored the early parenting experiences of 34 parents of pre-adolescent TGNC youth. Parents were recruited from online communities and listservs, and interviewed via phone about their early parenting experiences. Data were analyzed via thematic analysis. Findings indicate that parents became aware of their child\u2019s TGNC identity either through observing their child\u2019s gender behaviors, or by their child verbalizing their identity. Parents, on average, became aware of their child\u2019s gender identity exploration when they were just over 3 and a half years old. Parents felt a mix of emotions, with many reporting a lack of concern or positive emotions regarding their child\u2019s rejection of traditional gender roles. Parents without prior knowledge of transgender people or existing connections to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ+) people sought out information from the Internet. The findings are both consistent with and diverge from prior research with parents, suggesting both new areas for research, and additional ways in which TGNC youth and their parents can be best supported.\n\nKeywords: Transgender, children, parenting, gender identity\n\nAcknowledgements\nThank you to the participants who were willing to share their stories with us, to Abbey Hamburg, Claire Howard, Audriana Holstein, Alexis Pritchard, Deija Spencer, Juliet Vaspva, and Celeste Welsh for their assistance on this project, and to the anonymous reviewers who provided feedback on prior versions of this manuscript.\n\nDisclosure statement\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n\nFunding\nNotes\n1 The term \u201cTGNC\u201d is used for both consistency with prior literature and with the interview questions used in this project. However, other gender identities, including but not limited to gender expansive, nonbinary, and agender identities are included under this term.\n2 Not all transgender adults identified as transgender in childhood, and not all transgender adults engaged in gender atypical behaviors as children.\n3 One interview was removed from analyses as the interview contained inconsistencies and was vague, which taken together implied that some or all of the data were either inaccurate or fabricated.\n\nAdditional information\nFunding: This work was supported by a Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues Grant-in-Aid awarded to the first author.\n",

        "abstract": "This study examined how firms combine alliances and acquisitions in an exploration/exploitation framework. By conducting cluster analysis on a sample of 1270 acquisitions made by 836 firms, we first identified the patterns in alliance and acquisition activities undertaken by these firms. Five distinct patterns were identified: (I) low alliance\u2013low acquisition, (II) low alliance\u2013high acquisition, (III) high alliance\u2013low acquisition, (IV) high alliance\u2013high acquisition, and (V) medium alliance\u2013very high acquisition. Next, we analyzed the different ways in which the two modes were interlinked within these five patterns for exploration/exploitation. Patterns III and IV appeared to involve both exploration/exploitation and mutually reinforce exploration/exploitation. In contrast, in the remaining patterns, the two modes appeared to be more loosely coupled with each other, with a focus on exploitation.\n",

        "abstract": "As societies become more concerned with environmental protection, some firms go beyond their legal obligations and proactively adopt their own green management practices even if those practices cannot produce short-term benefits. As a result, researchers have begun to question the underlying motives of these firms. Leveraging corporate loss aversion, we argue that firms that outperform their peers become more risk-seeking to avoid any future loss of competitive advantage. As a result, they become more likely to engage in stakeholder management in the form of green management practices. Specifically, we explore the Green Power Partnership (GPP) which solicits firms to purchase green power. Using the data for the green power consumed by firms that are participating in the GPP program in the United States, we find that firms with performance above social aspiration are likely to increase their use of green power. We also find that related diversification has a negative influence on such motivation.\n",

        "abstract": "The emphasis on professional knowledge and practical research means methodological training in Ed.D. programs must prepare their candidates for the career demands graduates will likely encounter; practitioner research is well-suited to this task. Yet, the lower status traditionally accorded to practitioner research, along with an absence of clear guidelines for its methodology and quality, challenge its acceptance as a form of knowledge production. The current study analyzes 74 accounts of practitioner research in literacy for evidence of methodological quality. Findings reveal ways practitioner researchers systematically conduct and report their inquiries as well as areas for improvement. The hallmarks of quality identified in this study can be used to advance practitioner research as a methodology and knowledge generating endeavor.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nIn this article we analyze the landscape of dance teacher certification programs in the United States for the potential of anti-racist transformation in the field of dance education. We look at higher educational programming as a main place for revolutionary change in the future of dance education because the socio-political culture within curricula, pedagogies, policies, and practices of dance education in higher education maps to that of P-12 educational settings. This article enlists the aid of the work of Tema Okun and adrienne maree brown to envision the re-culturing of dance teacher certification programs through somatic social justice and Emergent Strategy. The article includes somatic reflective practices for the readers to engage in throughout the article to provide a lived, enacted experience of the long-term, sustainable change we propose for the future of dance education.\n\nKEYWORDS: White supremacy culture, dance teacher certification, somatic social justice, dance education, Emergent Strategy\n\nDisclosure Statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\n\nNotes\n1. Channing Brown (Citation2018) writes of her lived experience as a Black woman navigating her existence within organizations that have no understanding that they operate from Whiteness, and the exhaustive emotional labor of trying to make visible the daily problematic actions that result. This (in)visibility means that her needs and racist experiences with the foundational Whiteness of the organizations, visible to her, are invisible to those she works with.\n2. According to generative somatics practitioner Sumitra Rajkumar, somatics is a methodology that is fundamentally relational and political. It understands that unjust power dynamics inherent in our societies, cultures, and experiential perspectives shape us in deep, embodied ways (Werning Citation2018; McZeal Citation2021). Somatic social justice practices collective embodied healing for justly transforming society (Thom Citation2020).\n3. White silence occurs 'when people with white privilege stay complicitly silent when it comes to issues of race' (Saad Citation2020, 230). An impact of silencing is 'a defending of the status quo of white supremacy' (Saad Citation2020, 54) and a betrayal of the work toward liberation. Silencing can operate on an individual level, such as a dance professor not addressing racial harm in the studio or racism as a structural oppression in dance in their syllabus. It can also operate in group dynamics or systems, such as a dance department\u2019s enacted policies or certification programming curriculum.\n4. https://docs.ccsu.edu/curriculumsheets/DanceEdBS_CurriculumSheet.pdf.\n5. https://catalog.usm.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=24&poid=11,297.\n6. https://manoa.Hawaii.edu/liveonstage/dance/dance-programoverview/.\n7. https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/catalog/Current/CollegesDepartments/ls-intro/thtda.aspx?DeptTab=Courses.\n8. https://www.whitesupremacyculture.info/characteristics.html.\n9. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XR_7M_9qa64zZ00_JyFVTAjmjVU-uSz8/view.\n\nChanning Brown, Austin. 2018.

One of the effects of this liberation of language upon Miller\u2019s play is the incorporation into Salesman of plays on words that contribute substantially to the motifs and themes of the play. In this regard, \u201cWord/Play\u201d contributes to the ongoing interest in the careful and imaginative use of language in Salesman, which was neglected for so many years, by exploring comprehensively Miller\u2019s use of wordplay, essentially arguing that he employs the device to such an extent that recognizing its presence provides an additional key to the understanding of the play\u2019s many rich meanings.\n",

        "abstract": "Combat veterans in contemporary cinema are often silent. It\u2019s not just that they rarely speak about the war; they typically have less dialogue overall than other characters, even as they appear in many scenes of the film and are often at the center of it. For Bartle, the protagonist of *The Yellow Birds* (Alexandre Moors, 2017), based on a novel of the same name by Kevin Powers (2012), silence is a survival tool during training; early on, for instance, he urges Murph, who will eventually become his best friend, to be quiet lest their sergeant hear them talking while they\u2019re loading clips on the firing range. Silence for the post-war Bartle, however, is different, bound up not just with the combat he takes part in, but also with guilt, both for Murph\u2019s death and for a war crime that the film gradually reveals. And while not every contemporary film about returning veterans has a war crime at its center\u2014many such films, in fact, emphasize the veteran\u2019s heroism\u2014almost all cinematic combat veterans begin the film in silence.\nThis silence is but the first step in a remarkably consistent generic arc: the cinematic veteran, returned to the United States, is characterized by silence; the narrative works toward a moment, either positioned as the climax or very nearly there, where the veteran tells their story; the story is told to a listener who often directly elicits the story; and once this story is told, the narrative implies a healing of wounds, with a promise of the veteran rejoining the community, often through the listener. (The consequences of not telling the story result in a different outcome, as we will see.) This arc is also one that we find in cinematic veterans on screen in earlier eras; Keith Beattie, whose work I discuss at greater length below, has traced out the Vietnam Veteran\u2019s movement from silence to speech in narrative representation. But whereas for Beattie\u2019s Vietnam Veteran, that transformation took years, the contemporary arc takes a mere two hours, and it occurs every time we view the films. And even if this was true for some earlier films as well, the consistency of the contemporary arc within a feature-film time-frame bears scrutiny here.\nThis essay will trace out this arc, and explore each stage of it, within a single film: *The Yellow Birds*. By examining *The Yellow Birds*, my hope is that it might bring us a bit closer to understanding the stories we are telling ourselves about military veterans returning from contemporary U.S. wars. In doing so, I hope to begin shedding light on the ways we view those veterans, the ways we view those wars, and the truth and lies we tell ourselves about both.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Evidence suggests that cash transfers through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) programme induce better birth outcomes. We use US Vital Statistics data for all births in Maryland from 1995\u20132004 to capture the casual effects of implementing a local EITC programme across households. Alternative difference-in-differences (DD) comparison groups compare treatment households with like households in non-EITC counties and ineligible households in the same county. We find that the implementation of the local EITC reduced the probability of low birth weight by as much as 3.5 percentage points for births to White and Black mothers with little evidence of an effect for Hispanic mothers. This reduction represents a 46% decrease for White mothers and 26% decrease for Black mothers. Despite improving average birth outcomes, EITC cash transfers did not reduce disparities in birth outcomes.

        "abstract": "Stimulation in one sensory modality can affect perception in a separate modality, resulting in diverse effects including illusions in humans. This can also result in cross-modal facilitation, a process where sensory performance in one modality is improved by stimulation in another modality. For instance, a simple sound can improve performance in a visual task in both humans and cats. However, the range of contexts and underlying mechanisms that evoke such facilitation effects remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated cross-modal stimulation in wild-caught t\u00fangara frogs, a species with well-studied acoustic preferences in females. We first identified that a combined visual and seismic cue (vocal sac movement and water ripple) was behaviourally relevant for females choosing between two courtship calls in a phonotaxis assay. We then found that this combined cross-modal stimulus rescued a species-typical acoustic preference in the presence of background noise that otherwise abolished the preference. These results highlight how cross-modal stimulation can prime attention in receivers to improve performance during decision-making. With this, we provide the foundation for future work uncovering the processes and conditions that promote cross-modal facilitation effects.\n",

        "abstract": "Sexual minority people in the United States are less likely to have access to health services when compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Less is known about the within-group sociodemographic memberships among sexual minority people regarding access to health services. Using data from a nationally representative sample, a series of univariate and bivariate analyses were used to determine associations between sociodemographic group membership and access to health services. Results suggest there are significant differences in access to health services within the sexual minority population. Differences in access to health services when considering sex-at-birth, sexual identity, age, race/ethnicity, urbanicity, education level and income status were found. These findings offer insight into the role sociodemographic group membership has on the equity of access to health services. Specifically, results indicated that disproportionate access to health services among sexual minority people were more pronounced among those with group membership who experience social marginalisation. This was particularly true for sexual minority people who were bisexual, younger, Black and Latinx, lower-income earners and sexual minority people with less education attainment. Results from this study may be used to inform policies and practices aimed at improving access to health services including, but not limited to, the expansion of the Affordable Care Act and continued development of Federally Qualified Health Centers, while acknowledging the role of within-group differences among sexual minority people.\n\n### What is known about this topic\nSexual minority people report less access to health services when compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Some differences in access to health services within the sexual minority population have been documented.\n\n### What this paper adds\nThis paper reports differences in access to health services among sexual minority people living in the United States using a nationally representative sample. Findings suggest there are differences in access to health services within the sexual minority population when considering sex-at-birth, sexual identity, age, race/ethnicity, urbanicity, education level and income status.\n\n1 BACKGROUND\nSexual minority people, which includes those who identify as non-heterosexual, systematically report less access to health services when compared to heterosexual people (Albuquerque et al., 2016; Buchmueller & Carpenter, 2010; Heck et al., 2006; Luk et al., 2017). Sexual minority people are a large and diverse group of people who experience significant physical health disparities (Blosnich et al., 2014; Dahlhamer et al., 2016; Hafeez et al., 2017). In particular, sexual minority people are disproportionately diagnosed with HIV (Operario et al., 2015; P\u00e9rez et al., 2018), sexually transmitted infections (Hafeez et al., 2017; Operario et al., 2015), cancer (Quinn et al., 2015), and diabetes (Liu et al., 2019). These health outcomes are often preventable or highly treatable with consistent and time-appropriate access to health services (Shi, 2012). Access to health services is an effective strategy for addressing health disparities among marginalised groups of people (Derose et al., 2011; Healthy People, 2020; Institute of Medicine, 1993). Access to health services includes, but is not limited to, having a usual place of care to receive primary care services and receiving culturally appropriate services, as well as having health insurance coverage (Carmody, 2007; Healthy People, 2020; Institute of Medicine, 1993). Access to health insurance is associated with timely health service use and a reduction of chronic health conditions (Institute of Medicine, 1993; Lyon et al., 2014). A usual place of care to receive primary care services (which does not include emergency or hospital in-patient services) helps gain access to timely medical treatment or preventative health services (Devoe et al., 2008; Shi, 2012), while culturally appropriate health services address the experiences and concerns unique to specific populations (Healthy People, 2020). Sexual minority people are less likely to have health insurance coverage (Silvers, 2013; Skopec & Long, 2015) and are more likely to have trouble locating available health services (Dahlhamer et al., 2016). For example, Dahlhamer and colleagues found that gay men had greater difficulty finding a healthcare provider (8.5% vs. 4.2%) and a greater percentage of gay/lesbian women did not have a usual source of care (24.4% vs. 14.5%). Indeed, other work also indicates that sexual minority people are less likely to have a primary care service provider (Ward et al., 2014) and to delay seeking health services including when there is a need for health service use (Clift & Kirby, 2012; Jennings et al., 2019). Sexual minority people also experience barriers in accessing culturally appropriate health services (Johnson, 2017; Jowett & Peel, 2009) in the general medical community that consider their specific sexuality-related needs within an affirming, respectful and safe environment (Felsenstein, 2018). Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) health centres may offer sexual minority people a more culturally appropriate place to receive their health care as these services specialise in the medical treatment for this population (Martos et al., 2017), although the use of these services among sexual minority people is relatively unexplored. Health access disparities observed among sexual minority people may be rooted in heterosexism (Clift & Kirby, 2012; Green & Mirizio-Wheeler, 2019; Kerker et al., 2006; Underhill et al., 2015). Heterosexism is a systemic form of social marginalisation that subjects sexual minority people to various forms of discrimination and prejudice because of their non-heterosexual identities, attractions or behaviours (Herek, 1996). This is in accord with the Minority Stress Theory (Meyer, 2003), which posits that sexual minority people experience, anticipate and internalise discrimination because of their sexual minority identity. Sexual minority people may experience or anticipate physicians' refusal to treat sexual minority patients or mistreatment by medical staff which influences access to health care and the development of chronic health conditions (Frost et al., 2015; Green & Mirizio-Wheeler, 2019; Lick et al., 2013). Although differences in access to health services among sexual minority people compared to heterosexual people are well documented, less is known about the within-group sociodemographic group membership differences for sexual minority people regarding access to health services. In line with an intersectional approach, sexual minority people are members of varying sociodemographic group membership identities including various racial/ethnic backgrounds, ages, sex, socio-economic statuses, geographic locations and education (Ng, 2016; Parent et al., 2013). The sociodemographic group membership of sexual minority people within the sexual minority community is associated with disproportioned health outcomes not otherwise captured when looking exclusively at differences between sexual minority people and heterosexual people (Hafeez et al., 2017). For example, one recent study found that Black and Latinx older sexual minority people reported lower quality of physical health when compared to their White counterparts (Kim et al., 2017), while another study found Black sexual minority women were more likely to have a history of diabetes and hypertension, as well as lower physical activity and higher body mass index compared to White sexual minority women (Molina et al., 2014). Another study suggested bisexual older adults were more likely to live at or close to the poverty level (Fredriksen-Goldsen, Emlet, et al., 2013; Fredriksen-Goldsen, Kim, et al., 2013), which may impact health outcomes. Limited empirical evidence suggests differences in access to health services may exist between groups of sexual minority people by sociodemographic group membership. Older sexual minority people report engaging in healthcare services less often than younger sexual minority people (Green et al., 2018). Racial/ethnic minority sexual minority people have lower rates of health insurance coverage (Macapagal et al., 2016), while gay/lesbian females are more likely to have a usual source of care compared to bisexual females (Pharr et al., 2019). Yet, less is known about where health disparities exist in health insurance coverage, having a primary care service provider, and using culturally appropriate services in the form of LGBT-health services within diverse groups of sexual minority people. Thus, the goal of the current study was to examine sociodemographic group membership differences in access to health services within a national sample of sexual minority people. Examining these differences may further efforts to address sexual minority health disparities by highlighting the need for interventions aiming for health equity through improvement in access to health services.\n\n2 METHODS\n\n2.1 Study background\nData were used from the Generations study at wave 1. The Generations study was reviewed and approved by Gallup, Inc. and the University of California, Los Angeles, University of California, San Francisco, University of California, Santa Cruz, University of Texas at Austin, and University College London institutional review boards. The University of Southern California Institutional Review Board approved the current study.\n\n2.2 Recruitment\nParticipants for the Generations study (wave 1) were recruited by Gallup, Inc., a survey research consulting company, using the Gallup Daily Tracking Survey for initial contact. The tracking survey is a telephone interview of a national probability sample that collects data from ~1000 adults per day for 350 days about politics, economics and overall personal well-being. Respondents were eligible if they identified as lesbian, gay or bisexual, spoke English well enough to conduct a phone interview; and 18 or older and within two years of the study's target age cohort ages (cohort target ages: Cohort 1: 18\u201327 years; Cohort 2: 32\u201343 years; Cohort 3: 52\u201361). Eligibility criteria also included having an education level of sixth grade or above and self-identified as Black, Latinx or White. Eligible participants were contacted and invited to participate. Eligible participants were provided with an information sheet and provided informed consent. Transgender and transgender-identified gender non-binary people were not included, as a separate and more focused study was conducted on these individuals by the Generations study team. Participants received a $25 gift certificate for their participation. Participants were screened and enrolled between March 28, 2016, and March 30, 2017. An enhancement oversample of Black and Latinx participants was screened and enrolled between April 1, 2017, and March 30, 2018, to increase the number of these participants ensuring representation. A complete description of the Generations study methods can be accessed at Krueger et al., 2020.\n\n2.3 Sample\nGallup, Inc. initially screened 366,644 participants for eligibility in the Generations study, 3.5% identified as sexual minority people, with 27.5% of those deemed eligible for inclusion based on the eligibility criteria described above. Of those contacted, 80% agreed to participate and 48% completed the survey. The final sample consisted of 1518 sexual minority people ages 18\u201361 years; 53.5% female sex assigned at birth, 64.6% White, 15.7% Black, 19.0% Latinx, 44.1% younger adult and 31.4% older adult. For weighted percentages, see Table 1.\n\n3 RESULTS\nTable 1 displays sociodemographic group membership of the sample. The sample was composed of 60% female assigned at birth and 40% male assigned at birth. Gay/lesbian participants made up 46.9% of the sample followed by 40.6% bisexual, and 12.5% who were coded as \u201cother sexual identity.\u201d Younger participants (18\u201327 years) made up 61.7% of the sample, middle-age group participants (35\u201342) made up 20.9% of the sample and older participants (52\u201361 years) made up 17.4% of the sample. White participants made up the majority of the sample (62.2%), followed by Latinx participants (21.3%) and Black participants (16.5%). Most of the participants lived in urban areas (87%), while the rest in non-urban areas (13%). Those with a bachelor's degree or higher made up 25.6% and those with less than a bachelor's degree was 74.4%. The majority of the sample lived above the FPL (81%) compared to those living below (19%).\n\n3.1 Access to health services\nAmong the sample, 10.4% of participants did not have health insurance coverage, 20.9% did not have a primary care service provider and 13.2% had previously used LGBT-specific health services. Bivariate results by each index of access to health services are presented in Table 2. Results indicated several differences between sociodemographic group membership and access to health services: ...\n",

        "abstract": "## ABSTRACT\n\nBusiness students have long been noted for their differential proclivity to engage in academic misconduct. Unfortunately, the potential for misconduct has been exacerbated in recent years by rapid advances in technology, easy access to information, competitive pressures, and the proliferation of websites that provide students access to information that allows them to directly circumvent the learning process. Using a convenience sample of 631 students matriculating in various business majors at four U.S. universities and structural equations modeling procedures, this study assesses the effects of psychological factors on business students\u2019 propensities to utilize the services of homework assistance websites. Specifically, we examine how \u201cDark Triad\u201d personality traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) interact with Fraud Diamond elements to influence student decisions to engage the services of these websites. We find that each Dark Triad trait exerts a significant influence on at least one of the Fraud Diamond elements, which in turn have a significant direct or indirect positive association with students\u2019 reported intentions to utilize, and reported utilization of, these websites.\n\n**KEYWORDS:** Dark Triad, Fraud Diamond, business students, homework assistance websites\n\n**DISCLOSURE STATEMENT**\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\n**Notes**\n1 Chegg.com, Course Hero, and Quizlet are the three largest and most recognizable U.S.-based providers of homework assistance services.\n2 Figures 1 and 2 illustrate hypothesized and measured associations, respectively, and are not intended to imply causality.\n3 Harrison et al.\u2019s (Citation2018) full adaptation contains six items, three that measure primary psychopathy (i.e., morality), and three that measure secondary psychopathy (i.e., impulsiveness). Preliminary analyses indicated that the three secondary psychopathy items had weak loadings on a second-order psychopathy factor, thus prompting us to exclude them from further analysis. The exclusion of these three items enhanced fit of the empirically tested model but did not result in significantly different structural associations among the latent constructs.\n4 Harrison et al. (Citation2018) premised their Fraud Diamond questions centered on the opportunity to earn an additional $100 from overstating the condition of a tablet computer in an online advertisement.\n5 Readers interested in the database used for this study may contact the senior author.\n6 Because not all students at the various institutions were solicited for participation, the 15% figure cited above understates the actual response rate, albeit to an unknown degree due to our inability to feasibly ascertain how many students actually opened and read their e-mail solicitations to participate in the study.\n7 Scott\u2019s (Citation1961) findings are based on analyses of mail survey response rates. With respect to web-based surveys, Wells et al. (Citation2012) prescribe that \u201cSurvey researchers who utilize web-based administrative methods should consider using multiple sources of leverage when soliciting participation and must carefully evaluate sample representativeness\u201d (p. 455). This study\u2019s compliance with these admonitions is evidenced by the multiple means of soliciting student participation, the effort to assess non-response bias reported above, and the gender analyses reported below.\n8 While females comprised approximately 38% of the combined undergraduate business student populations from the participating schools, they comprised 59% of this study\u2019s sample. This finding is congruent with prior research among college students which indicates that female students and ethnic majority students are more likely to respond to paper and web-based surveys (e.g., see, Van Mol, Citation2017). However, this disparity motivated the gender-based moderation analyses reported below.\n9 The business model for both Course Hero and Quizlet is predicated on course-specific, student-provided content.\n10 Hair et al. (Citation2019) caution against putting too much reliance on model fit measures in PLS-SEM.\n11 Hair et al. (Citation2020) note that because composite reliability is weighted it is more accurate than Cronbach\u2019s alpha which is unweighted and suggest that the former is the preferred measure to report: they also indicate that if either of these measures is 0.950 or higher, it is an indication that \u201cthe individual items are measuring the same concept, and are therefore redundant (p. 104).\n12 The correlation between motivation and rationalization (0.940), though above Henseler et al.\u2019s (Citation2015) upper threshold of 0.90, still has an upper interval value below 1.00. Conceptually, the fact that these two constructs are highly correlated is not surprising. Those who have a great deal of motivation to engage in the act would also find it commensurately easier to rationalize the act.\n13 Harrison et al. (Citation2018) did not report f2 values in the comparison study.\n14 See Shmueli et al. (Citation2019) for a full discussion of prediction statistics that can be used to assess the degree of prediction error.\n15 Shmueli et al. (Citation2019) state that the Q2predict value for each indicator must be greater than zero before the RMSE (and/or MAE) values for the PLS-SEM model can compared to the respective na\u00efve linear benchmark values. As Table 8 illustrates, this criterion is satisfied for both Action indicators.\n16 This finding is congruent with prior research (e.g., for a review see, Landay et al., Citation2019).\n17 Smith et al. (Citation2021) used a sample of accounting students to find that the elements of the Dark Triad exerted both unique and synergistic effects on the ethical decision-making process in general, and on rationalization in particular.\n18 Twenty-nine percent of students taking an extra-credit online quiz were presumed to be using a homework assistance website to take assessment before requiring the use of the integrity tool compared to five percent after.\n19 Psychopathy is presumed to be normally distributed in the population with between five and fifteen percent afflicted with subclinical psychopathy and approximately one percent categorized as clinical (LeBreton et al., Citation2006).\n",

Harris, Margaret Rahmoeller & Lisa Schneider\n\nAbstract\nKostant\u2019s partition function counts the number of distinct ways to express a weight of a classical Lie algebra g as a sum of positive roots of g. We refer to each of these expressions as decompositions of a weight. Our main result considers an infinite family of weights, irrespective of Lie type, for which we establish a closed formula for the q\u2011analog of Kostant\u2019s partition function and then prove that the (normalized) distribution of the number of positive roots in the decomposition of any of these weights converges to a Gaussian distribution as the rank of the Lie algebra goes to infinity. We also extend these results to the highest root of the classical Lie algebras and we end our analysis with some directions for future research.\n\nKeywords\nKostant's partition function, q-analog of Kostant's partition function, Gaussian distribution\n\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification\n05E10, 22E60, 05A15\n\nAuthor information\nAuthor and Affiliations\nPamela E.

The polemical qualities of his conversation are analyzed in examples drawn from the biographical. The bulk of the chapter consists of close analysis of his Parliamentary Debates, which are seen in dialogue with other aspects of print and manuscript culture, and argues that the printed form of these debates may be best described as \u201cconcatenated polemic.\u201d The conclusion turns to further examples drawn from Johnson\u2019s late political writing as well as his literary criticism. In sum, Johnson arrives at some of his most significant insights in the heat of controversy, frequently engaging in dialogue with other texts that is deliberately aggressive and unsparing.\n",

Organizations regularly used law/crime spot news to frame protests. The findings may signal a potential shift away from the media\u2019s protest paradigm.\n",

        "abstract": "While the impact of negative customer treatment on service employees and their organizations is often emphasized in both scholarship and the popular press, relatively little work has examined the effects of customercourtesy. We draw on the social cognitive theory to theorize that customer courtesy can enhance service performance via its positive effect on employee self\u2010efficacy. Although getting customers to display courtesy may be outside an organization's direct control, we reason that management can amplify these benefits by establishing a strong organizational support climate. To examine our predictions, we developed a customer courtesy scale, then deployed it among service employees in the United States (Study 1) and hotel employees and their supervisors in East Asia (Study 2). We also collected experimental data (Study 3) to test our causal model. Across our studies, our data support the benefits of customer courtesy on employee self\u2010efficacy and, by extension, employee service performance. Moreover, our data reveal that when organizational support climate increases, the effect of customer courtesy on self\u2010efficacy and thus, service performance increases. Although it may be the case that bad is sometimes stronger than good, our work highlights the importance of positive workplace interactions (e.g., customer courtesy) on valued employee outcomes.\n",

        "abstract": "Objectives: During the COVID-19 pandemic, university faculty experienced an emergency pivot to online instruction in the Spring 2020 semester. Many had no prior online teaching experience and were given little time to adapt. This study examines pre-pandemic online teaching experience and training strategies used to learn how to teach online during the emergency remote teaching semester, perceptions of change in online teaching ability and the pandemic\u2019s impact on teaching effectiveness, and interest in future online teaching opportunities. Method: Full-time faculty (<em>n</em> = 455) from four public regional universities in the southern United States completed a survey at the start of the Fall 2020 semester. Results: Over 35% had no prior online teaching experience, while 43% had taught several online courses. During the pandemic, in an effort to learn or improve online teaching skills, 13.4% sought peer mentoring, 31.9% completed a training program, and 34.9% both sought mentoring and completed training. Perceived online teaching skills, impact of the pandemic on teaching effectiveness, and interest in future online teaching were significantly related to prior online teaching experience and training sought. Conclusions: Faculty with less online experience perceived a greater negative effect of the pandemic on teaching performance and had less interest in future online teaching. Both mentoring and training enhanced perceived teaching skills, lowered the negative impact of the pandemic on teaching effectiveness, and promoted a positive attitude about future online teaching. Implications for Theory or Practice: The results provide support for the importance of faculty development programs in shaping attitudes and perceived effectiveness in online teaching and add to existent research on university faculty during the pandemic. Evidence from studies such as this provides universities with data that may be used to re-evaluate induction and training to improve instructional delivery in future instances when emergency remote teaching is required.\n",

Several famous VIs have endorsed fashion brands, appearing in the advertising campaigns (e.g., Lil Miquela x Prada). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of using VIs as fashion brand endorsers. Specifically, we tested the impacts of the five perceived characteristics of VIs (attractiveness, innovativeness, curiosity, authenticity, and controllability) on consumer\u2019s attitudes to the advertisement featuring VIs, brand attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward the brand. Data were collected from 252 consumers aged in 18-25 through Amazon MTurk. Structural equation modeling results indicated that the more consumers perceived VIs as attractive, authentic, controllable, and curious, the more positively they reacted to the advertisement featuring VIs as well as to the brand (and vice versa). Brand attitudes influenced behavioral intentions toward the brand. Consumer\u2019s innovativeness and market mavenism were significant moderating variables.\n\n**Keywords:** Virtual influencers, virtual humanoids, influencer marketing\n\n**How to Cite:**\nLee, J. & Park, K., (2022) \u201cI Am a Digital Human\u201d: Effectiveness of Using Virtual Influencers as Fashion Brand Endorsers\u201d, International Textile and Apparel Association Annual Conference Proceedings 79(1). doi: https://doi.org/10.31274/itaa.15991\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe effect of R&D investment on firm performances is subject of a number of internal factors. The dynamics of this effect is unclear in the literature. Based on the knowledge-based view and theory of intellectual capital, this research establishes a theoretical model to test the interrelationships among R&D investment, intellectual capital, organizational learning, and firm performance. We obtained seven years\u2019 panel data from two data centers, and applied mediation and moderation models to investigate the interrelationships. Our findings show while intellectual capital fully mediates the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance, organizational learning moderates the relationship between R&D investment and human capital. Our results show the important roles of intellectual capital and organizational learning in enhancing the effectiveness of R&D investment.\nKeywords: Intellectual capital, organizational learning, software quality, R&D, firm performance\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\nCorrection Statement\nThis article has been corrected with minor changes.

        "abstract": "We used compound\u2010specific isotope analysis of carbon isotopes in amino acids (AAs) to determine the biosynthetic source of AAs in fish from major tributaries to California's Sacramento\u2010San Joaquin river delta (i.e., the Sacramento, Cosumnes and Mokelumne rivers). Using samples collected in winter and spring between 2016 and 2019, we confirmed that algae are a critical component of floodplain food webs in California's Central Valley. Results from bulk stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen in producers and consumers were adequate to characterize a general trophic structure and identify potential upstream and downstream migration into our study site by American shadAlosa sapidissimaand rainbow troutOncorhynchus mykiss, respectively. However, owing to overlap and variability in source isotope compositions, our bulk data were unsuitable for conventional bulk isotope mixing models. Our results from compound\u2010specific carbon isotope analysis of AAs clearly indicate that algae are important sources of organic matter to fish of conservation concern, such as Chinook salmonOncorhynchus tshawytschain California's Central Valley. However, algae were not the exclusive source of energy to metazoan food webs. We also revealed that other sources of AAs, such as bacteria, fungi and higher plants, contributed to fish as well. While consistent with the well\u2010supported notion that algae are critical to aquatic food webs, our results highlight the possibility that detrital subsidies might intermittently support metazoan food webs.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nMatching the supply of medical equipment with soaring demand caused by an epidemic event is a daunting challenge. Focusing on medical equipment manufacturers, this study empirically examines how supply chain management impacts manufacturers\u2019 responses to epidemic-driven demand. This study employs novel supply chain data from South Korea collected before and after the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic event. In the results, we show that such an epidemic positively influences the sales performance of medical equipment manufacturers (i.e. a 10.2 percentage-point increase). To identify the mechanism behind this result, we provide evidence that increasing the supply base (i.e. the number of supply channels) enables medical equipment manufacturers to better respond to epidemic-driven demand and ultimately improves their sales performance. More interestingly, we find that medical equipment manufacturers with lower market status (i.e. lower market shares and lower supplier shares) expand their supply bases more extensively than other medical equipment manufacturers with higher market status do. Interpreting these results, we offer managerial insights into how medical equipment manufacturers can effectively manage their supply chains and improve their performance when responding to epidemic-driven demand.\n\nKEYWORDS: Supply base, supply channel, epidemic and pandemic, epidemic-driven demand, empirical study\n\nData availability statement\nThe data supporting the findings of this study are available from eCredible.

        "abstract": "## Abstract\nPrimary care services are cornerstones for US health care, assuring preventive screening, maintenance of therapeutics, and access to specialty care. Sexual minority (SM) adults are less likely to have access to primary care services than their heterosexual counterparts. Additionally, access to health services among SM persons can vary by age. One plausible explanation for these disparities are experiences of minority stress. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the association between experiences of minority stress and access to primary care services among SM people in the United States across multiple age cohorts. A series of logistic regressions examined associations among multiple experiences of minority stress and access to primary care services. Analyses, stratified by age cohort, examined associations between experiences of minority stress and access to primary care services. Felt stigma, on average, was negatively associated with having a primary care provider among the full sample. The stratified analysis revealed that higher rates of felt stigma were negatively associated with having a primary care provider only among younger SM adults. This study offers novel information suggesting that unique experiences of minority stress are linked with barriers in access to primary care services among SM people.\n\n**Keywords**: Sexual minority adults, primary care services, minority stress\n\n**Disclosure statement** No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\n**Additional information** Funding Generations is funded by a grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD grant 1R01HD078526) and through supplemental grants from the National Institutes of Health, Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, and the Office of Research on Women\u2019s Health.

        "abstract": "The use of evidence in bolstering message believability has been shown in the literature. However, more work is needed to understand the effect of evidence in the monetary donation context for nonprofit organizations. This paper aims to partially close the knowledge gap in this area by (i) comparing the effectiveness of statistical and narrative donation messages on message believability, (ii) investigating the moderating effect of abstract and concrete mindset on the relationship between message type and believability, and (iii) analyzing the resulting effect on subsequent donation intentions. Our findings show that there is no difference in the effect of statistical versus narrative messages on message believability when the recipient of the message is in abstract mindset. However, when the recipient is in concrete mindset, statistical messages lead to stronger believability perceptions. Furthermore, higher believability is found to increase individual monetary donation intentions. \n\n**KEYWORDS**: Nonprofit, evidence type, mindset, message believability, donation intention\n\n**Disclosure statement**: No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\n**Funding**: This work was supported by the Louisiana State University Shreveport [PG009145].\n\n**Notes on contributors**: \n- **Ahmet Koksal**: Assistant Professor in the department of Management and Marketing, College of Business, Louisiana State University in Shreveport.

        "abstract": "## BACKGROUND:\nThe red imported fire ant,Solenopsis invictaBuren, is a significant urban, agricultural, and medical pest with a wide distribution in the world. Surface or mound treatment using contact insecticide is one of the main methods to controlS. invicta. In the present study, cycloxaprid, a newly discovered neonicotinoid insecticide, was evaluated forS. invictacontrol and compared with two referent insecticides, imidacloprid and bifenthrin.\n\n## RESULTS:\nSurfaces or sand treated with cycloxaprid, imidacloprid, or bifenthrin caused high mortality ofS. invictaworkers, and the action of cycloxaprid or imidacloprid was slower than bifenthrin. Like imidacloprid and bifenthrin, cycloxaprid can be horizontally transferred from corpses or live donor ants to recipient ants. In addition, cycloxaprid\u2010 or imidacloprid\u2010treated surfaces significantly induced the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and detoxification enzymes; nevertheless, they had no significant effect on the foraging behaviors ofS. invictaworkers. Also, sand treated with cycloxaprid or imidacloprid did not negatively affect the digging activities of ants. Interestingly,S. invictaworkers excavated significantly more sand containing 0.01\u2009mg/kg cycloxaprid than untreated sand in the no\u2010choice digging bioassays. In addition, extensive nesting activities (sand excavation and stacking) were observed in the flowerpots containing untreated sand or sand treated with cycloxaprid or imidacloprid. On the contrary, bifenthrin significantly reduced the foraging, digging, and nesting activities ofS. invictaworkers.\n\n## CONCLUSION:\nCycloxaprid is a slow\u2010acting and nonrepellent insecticide againstS. invictaworkers, and its contact and horizontal toxicities are slightly higher than imidacloprid. \u00a9 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.\n",

        "abstract": "In this study, we examined the succession of soil microbial communities across a chronosequence of newly constructed salt marshes constructed primarily of fine-grained dredge material, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequences. Alpha diversity in the parent material was initially low and increased to reference levels within 3 years of marsh construction, while in the newly accumulating organic matter-rich surface soils alpha diversity was initially high and remained unchanged. Microbial community succession was fastest in the surface horizon (~\u200924 years to reference equivalency) and became progressively slower with depth in the subsurface horizons (~\u200930\u201367 years). Random forest linear regression analysis was used to identify important taxa driving the trajectories toward reference conditions. In the parent material, putative sulfate-reducers (Desulfobacterota), methanogens (Crenarchaeota, especiallyMethanosaeta), and fermenters (ChloroflexiandClostridia) increased over time, suggesting an enrichment of these metabolisms over time, similar to natural marshes. Concurrently in the surface soils, the relative abundances of putative methane-, methyl-, and sulfide oxidizers, especially amongGammaproteobacteria, increased over time, suggesting the co-development of sulfide and methane removal metabolisms in the marsh soils. Finally, we observed that the surface soil communities at one of the marshes did not follow the trajectory of the others, exhibiting a greater relative abundance of anaerobic taxa. Uniquely in this dataset, this marsh was developing signs of excessive inundation stress in terms of vegetation coverage and soil geochemistry. Therefore, we suggest that soil microbial community structures may be effective bioindicators of salt marsh inundation and are worthy of further targeted investigation.\n",

Predation rates by juveniles (50-90 mm) were examined at 5 daytime light levels (6 \u00d7 1011to 2 \u00d7 1014quanta s-1cm-2) and in darkness and 4 turbidity levels (clear [\u22641], 11, 20, and 40 NTU) at an intermediate light level. Both species fed equally well on benthopelagic mysid shrimp and benthic spionid polychaetes at all daytime light levels tested. However, predation on mysids was significantly reduced in the dark. Consumption of polychaetes was not reduced in the dark by either species, illustrating the effectiveness of non-visual foraging methods on benthic prey. Turbidity levels tested did not affect predation on either prey type by either flounder species. Locomotor behavior was examined at the same turbidity levels.P. lethostigmaspent more time swimming in the water column thanP. dentatusin lower turbidity (clear-20 NTU), and both species reduced swimming at 40 NTU. It appears that both species primarily use a benthic-oriented ambush foraging strategy under high turbidity conditions. This is a particularly pronounced switch in foraging style forP. lethostigma. Estuarine turbidity is increasing due to the impacts of climate change. When turbidity is elevated enough to eliminate light sufficient for visual feeding on mysids (between darkness and the lowest light level tested), feeding on this motile prey is negatively impacted for both species. Turbidity can thus alter foraging modes and types of prey consumed, affecting nursery habitat quality and the prey base supporting these young fishes.\n",

        "abstract": "Land development, pollution, and waste have affected natural environments, contributing to hurricanes, wildfires, and pandemic infectious diseases like COVID-19. Globalized corporate food systems that produce ultra-refined foods with low nutritional value contribute to both environmental conditions and health conditions like obesity and undernutrition. This has the greatest impact on communities already suffering from elevated health risks driven by economic inequities rooted in racism. These interacting environmental, health, and social conditions represent a syndemic. We outline practical suggestions to address this syndemic of environmental degradation, pandemic infectious disease, chronic disease, undernutrition, and inequity through research and practice at many levels, including individual behavior, local communities, and regional, national and global policy. Collaboration with communities is central to simultaneously tackling interconnected human and environmental health threats. For example, community-led groups have increased access to healthy food in response to pandemic conditions. Building on behavioral medicine\u2019s rich foundation of ecological models, communities have partnered with local researchers to address the needs of equitable public transport and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through multilevel research and practice. Policymakers, researchers, practitioners, and community members should collaborate with each other and across disciplines to find lasting, multiduty solutions to improve physical, psychosocial, and planetary health.\n",

        "abstract": "In general, males should be particularly attentive to cues of sexual availability and females should advertize accordingly. Vaginal patency (i.e., the openness of the vagina) is a reliable indicator of sexual maturity; if the vagina is closed, the female is unable to copulate. The southern giant pouched rat (Cricetomys ansorgei) is unusual because females can have fully fused vaginal openings (i.e., vaginal nonpatency) despite being considered \u201cadults\u201d by other metrics. Moreover, some females reversibly close their vaginal openings. Thus, vaginal patency in the pouched rat is a \u201cflexible\u201d reproductive state. We subcutaneously implanted a long-acting GnRH agonist (deslorelin), which over time inhibits sex steroid secretion, to better understand the endocrinology and social behavior relating to vaginal patency in this species. We hypothesized that altering GnRH would impact both patency and behavior through its effects on circulating levels of estradiol. Six months of deslorelin treatment did not alter vaginal patency. Behaviorally, deslorelin-treated females spent less time interacting with, and were more aggressive towards males (compared to controls). Notably, deslorelin did not alter female scent marking. We conclude that behavioral receptivity, but not vaginal patency, is impacted by GnRH hormonal cascades in the pouched rat.\n",

The project provides valid and important results in an immediate sense, while also establishing the foundation for strengthening the media curriculum at educational institutions. For educators, this has positive implications, as along with the traditional content we teach, we also strive to increase the awareness of civic issues among our students to make them better citizens.\n",

        "abstract": "## Background:\nGuidelines allow for the omission of radiotherapy in older women with early\u2010stage, hormone\u2010receptor\u2010positive breast cancer, given that the patients receive adequate endocrine therapy (ET). However, the initiation of ET and survival outcomes after forgoing radiation therapy among these patients have not been well\u2010studied.\n\n## Methods:\nWe identified patients aged 70 to 90\u2009years old newly diagnosed in 2010\u20132015 with early\u2010stage, hormone receptor positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative (HR+/Her2\u2212) breast cancer who received lumpectomy and omitted radiation therapy using the SEER\u2010Medicare database. We examined the initiation of ET and the utilization patterns of ET using a multivariable logistic regression. We further examined the overall survival outcomes using Kaplan\u2013Meier estimation and Cox proportional hazard model with inverse probability weighting.\n\n## Results:\nOf the 2618 patients, 808 (30.9%) received no ET. The multivariable logistic regression showed that more recent years had better ET initiation (2013\u20132015 vs. 2010\u20132012: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI:[1.16, 1.66]), while older patients (81\u201390 vs. 70\u201380: OR\u00a0=\u00a00.45, 95% CI:[0.38, 0.54]) were less likely to receive ET. Both the Kaplan\u2013Meier estimation (log\u2010rank p\u2010value<0.0001) and the Cox proportional hazard model with inverse probability weighting (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.76, 95% CI:[0.58, 0.99]) showed that receiving ET was associated with better overall survival.\n\n## Conclusion:\nThis population\u2010based study suggests that a sizable proportion of patients who omitted radiation did not receive endocrine therapy and receiving endocrine therapy was beneficial among these patients. Although ET initiation has improved in more recent years, certain patient groups were still especially susceptible to no endocrine therapy.\n",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine whether vision-occluded progressive resistance training would increase upper-extremity movement performance using the one-repetition maximum (1-RM) bench press. Participants (n = 57) were recruited from a historically black college and university (HBCU), cross-matched by sex, age (\u00b11 year), 1-RM (\u00b12.27 kg), 1-RM/weight (\u00b10.1), and 1-RM/lean mass ratio (\u00b10.1), and randomly assigned to either the experimental group (vision occluded) or the control group. Participants performed resistance training for 6 weeks prior to beginning the study, and 1-RM was assessed the week prior to the beginning of the study. Weight and body composition were measured using a BOD POD. Of the 57 participants who started the study, 34 completed the study (Experimental = 16, Control = 18) and were reassessed the week after completing the 6-week-long training protocol. Using a combination of Mann\u2013Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, we found that when accounting for changes in lean muscle mass, individuals who trained with their vision occluded reported significantly greater improvements in 1-RM strength compared to those who did not (p < 0.05). The findings from our study suggest that vision-occluded progressive resistance training increases upper-extremity performance when assessed using the bench press. These findings may have significant practical implications in both sports and rehabilitation, as these techniques may be used to enhance performance in athletes and/or improve rehabilitation effectiveness.\n",

We create a sample of 2786 giants and 24\u2009496 dwarfs with stellar parameters and multiple radial velocities from the APOGEE pipeline, projected rotation speeds vsin\u2009i determined from our own pipeline, and distances, masses, and ages measured by Sanders\u00a0& Das. We use the statistical distribution of the maximum shift in the radial velocities, \u0394RVmax, as a proxy for the close binary fraction to explore the interplay between stellar evolution, rotation, and multiplicity. Assuming that the minimum orbital period allowed is the critical period for Roche Lobe overflow and rotational synchronization, we calculate theoretical upper limits on expected vsin\u2009i and \u0394RVmax values. These expectations agree with the positive correlation between the maximum \u0394RVmax and vsin\u2009i values observed in our sample as a function of log(g). We find that the fast rotators in our sample have a high occurrence of short-period [log(P/d) \u2272 4] companions. We also find that old, rapidly rotating main-sequence stars have larger completeness-corrected close binary fractions than their younger peers. Furthermore, rapidly rotating stars with large \u0394RVmax consistently show differences of 1\u201310\u00a0Gyr between the predicted gyrochronological and measured isochronal ages. These results point towards a link between rapid rotation and close binarity through tidal interactions. We conclude that stellar rotation is strongly correlated with stellar multiplicity in the field, and caution should be taken in the application of gyrochronology relations to cool stars.\n",

        "abstract": "## Abstract\nEthics are principles which provide a framework for making decisions that best reflect a set of values. Cataloging carries power, so ethical decision-making is crucial. Because cataloging requires decision-making in areas that differ from other library work, cataloging ethics are a distinct subset of library ethics. Cataloging ethics draw on the primary values of serving the needs of users and providing access to materials. Cataloging ethics are not new, but they have received increased attention since the 1970s. Major current issues in cataloging ethics include the creation of a code of ethics; ongoing debate on the appropriate role of neutrality in cataloging misleading materials and in subject heading lists and classification schemes; how and to what degree considerations of privacy and self-determination should shape authority work; and whether or not our current cataloging codes are sufficiently user-focused.\n\n**Keywords:** Cataloging ethics, radical cataloging, critical cataloging, cataloging values, neutrality, ethical issues\n\n**Acknowledgements**\nThe author would like to thank Violet Fox, Nicole Kulp, and Audrey Schadt for their feedback on an early draft of this article. The author would also like to thank the anonymous peer reviewers and Gretchen Hoffman and Karen Snow for their feedback on a later draft.\n\n**Notes on contributor**\nJennifer M. Martin is the Cataloging and Metadata Services Librarian at Salisbury University. Her primary job responsibilities include cataloging materials for the Ernie Bond Curriculum Resource Center and the Nabb Research Center for Delmarva History and Culture; reviewing metadata in SOAR@SU, the university\u2019s institutional repository; managing WorldCat Discovery, the university\u2019s discovery layer and knowledge base; and coordinating collection development training for the SU Libraries.\n",

        "abstract": "## Abstract\nStatistics is an important component of the knowledge base for health care professionals. In this essay, it is argued that statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT) should be considered an important component of their preparation as well. Health care professionals often must help others understand the statistical basis for recommendations they make. A COVID-19 press briefing is used to illustrate the need for SKT when making high-stakes recommendations related to public health. It is conjectured that efforts to educate the public during the press briefing would have been enhanced if the presenters had deeper knowledge of the general public\u2019s common statistical thinking patterns, the typical statistics curriculum experienced by members of their audience, and contemporary tools for teaching statistics. The importance of such knowledge to support smaller-scale individual interactions is also discussed. A call for SKT-centered partnerships between educational researchers and medical researchers is made; such partnerships could be mutually beneficial to the development of both fields and to society at large.\n\n**Keywords:** Dynamic statistics software, Medical research, Pedagogical content knowledge, Statistical knowledge for teaching, Statistical thinking\n\n## 1 Introduction\nIt is widely accepted that statistics is an important part of the knowledge base for those in the health professions (e.g., World Federation for Medical Education Citation 2015; Oster and Enders Citation 2018). Statistical knowledge allows health care professionals to understand research literature and conduct their own studies. Although the specific statistical concepts to be addressed and appropriate pedagogical approaches are at times under-specified in standards for medical education (Hayat Citation 2014), few would argue against requiring those entering the health professions to study statistics.\n\nThis essay focuses on a different type of knowledge that health care professionals should have: statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT). SKT is not equivalent to statistical knowledge. Concisely stated, SKT is knowledge that allows one to make statistics comprehensible to others (Groth Citation 2013). Health care professionals need to help people make evidence-based decisions about courses of action for preserving and improving their well-being (Nelson et al. Citation 2002), though their ability and confidence to do so are sometimes questionable (Rao Citation 2008). Doctors and nurses frequently make data-based recommendations during private interactions with individuals; government officials charged with preserving public health are sometimes called upon to do so on a large scale in public. This educational responsibility was especially visible during the COVID-19 pandemic. This essay argues that having statistical knowledge alone is not sufficient to teach the public about the evidential basis for recommended health practices. It is also important to have knowledge of effective teaching practices that account for how people generally interpret statistics.\n\nThe essay begins with a brief description of the nature of SKT and how it overlaps, with yet differs from, from statistical and mathematical knowledge. Then, the notion of SKT is used to reflect upon a widely viewed press briefing in which two prominent health care professionals in the United States tried to explain the statistical basis for COVID-19 mitigation measures and treatments at a critical point in the pandemic timeline. The major statistical concepts they dealt with during the press briefing are discussed, and conjectures about how their attempt to educate the public may have been enhanced by deeper SKT are made. Broader implications about the need for SKT among health care professionals around the world and strategies for meeting the need are then considered.\n\n## 2 The Nature of SKT\nSKT encompasses more than just statistics subject matter knowledge; it also includes pedagogical content knowledge (Groth Citation 2013). Shulman (Citation 1987) characterized pedagogical content knowledge as the \u201cspecial amalgam of content and pedagogy that is uniquely the province of teachers, their own special form of professional understanding\u201d (p. 8). Having subject matter expertise alone does not make one an effective teacher; good statisticians may or may not have pedagogical skill. Pedagogical content knowledge has been studied extensively within the context of teachers in conventional classroom settings (Depaepe, Verschaffel, and Kelchtermans Citation 2013); the present article extends the consideration of pedagogical content knowledge to health care professionals charged with making evidence-based recommendations to the public.\n\nHill, Ball, and Schilling (Citation 2008) discussed three essential components of pedagogical content knowledge: knowledge of content and students, knowledge of content and teaching, and curriculum knowledge. These three components have been used widely in research on SKT (Langrall et al. Citation 2017). Knowledge of content and students involves knowing how individuals commonly understand, and misunderstand, statistics content. Such knowledge supports knowledge of content and teaching, which allows for the selection of pedagogical strategies that leverage existing student understandings and address their common misunderstandings. A third component of pedagogical content knowledge, curriculum knowledge, provides understanding of the broad frameworks and learning progressions that generally undergird the teaching of statistics.\n\nAlong with being more than just statistical subject matter knowledge, SKT is also more than just mathematical knowledge. Undoubtedly, a great deal of mathematical knowledge is needed to teach statistics. However, considerable amounts of nonmathematical knowledge are needed as well. For example, those who teach statistics must know how to distinguish between deterministic and stochastic questions, construct surveys, design studies, and interpret results in context (Groth Citation 2007). Mathematical knowledge is necessary, but not sufficient, for such tasks. Many statistical tasks are highly context-dependent and not reducible to deterministic algorithms and conclusions. At its core, statistics is the study of variation and uncertainty. This stands in contrast to mathematics, in which deductive reasoning can lead to definitive proofs. Mathematical tools are helpful for statistical tasks, yet we cannot expect them to produce conclusions as certain as those of mathematical proofs in most statistical contexts. Reconciling certainty in mathematics with uncertainty in statistics is a nontrivial task. Knowing how to help the public distinguish between statistical and mathematical conclusions during a time of anxiety such as the COVID-19 pandemic is especially challenging, as people naturally seek unequivocal answers to questions that cannot be answered with complete certainty.\n\n## 3 SKT in the Context of a COVID-19 Press Briefing\nIn the United States, at the outset of the pandemic, Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci were charged with explaining the basis for government-led COVID-19 mitigation and efforts to develop treatments and vaccines. On March 31, 2020, the two doctors employed statistical tools and arguments during a press briefing to do so. The press briefing came at a critical time, as the United States had recorded just a small percentage of its eventual deaths from the virus (approximately 4000 of what would grow to be over 250,000), and audiences for the daily briefings from the White House were averaging approximately 8 million viewers (Grynbaum Citation 2020). A primary goal of the briefing was to argue in favor of extending existing mitigation measures, which included stay-at-home orders, business closures, and maintaining social distance in public. Video of the press briefing was posted online afterward (e.g., https://www.c-span.org/video/?470841-1/white-house-warns-upcoming-painful-weeks&live=). Quotes in this essay were drawn from the government video transcript (available from https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-15/). The statistical subject matter of the press briefing included models, disaggregation of data, and experimental study design. Next, a summary of how Drs. Birx and Fauci dealt with each of these statistical ideas during the press briefing is given, followed by conjectures about how deeper SKT related to the three main statistical ideas may have enhanced their efforts to teach the public.\n\n### 3.1 Press Briefing Introductory Presentation Summary\nDr. Birx began her portion of the press briefing by projecting the slide shown in Figure 1. Two curves appeared on the slide: one to illustrate the spread of COVID-19 without mitigation measures, and another to illustrate its spread with mitigation measures fully in place. She explained that the curves were based on modeling done by \u201cfive or six international and domestic modelers from Harvard, from Columbia, from Northeastern, from Imperial who helped us tremendously.\u201d In reference to the curve on the far left in Figure 1, Dr. Birx stated, \u201cIn their estimates, they had between 1.5 million and 2.2 million people in the United States succumbing to this virus without mitigation.\u201d She explained that the curve on the far right showed projected deaths if mitigation measures such as social distancing and hand-washing were fully implemented, saying, \u201cwhat an extraordinary thing this could be if every American followed these, and it takes us to that stippled mountain that\u2019s much lower\u2014a hill, actually\u2014down to 100,000 to 200,000 deaths, which is still way too much.\u201d\n\n[**Figure 1**](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/823916343/coronavirus-task-force-set-to-detail-the-data-that-led-to-extension-of-guideline): Slide 1 in the press briefing presentation.

Display full size\n\nNext, Dr. Birx projected the slide shown in Figure 2 and said it was from the work of a modeler at the University of Washington who took hospital need data from around the world into account. She explained that the graph depicted what would be possible with full implementation of the government\u2019s mitigation measures, and that the model was being continuously updated each day by using new data. Dr. Birx further argued for full implementation of the recommended mitigation measures by showing a third slide with a graph (Figure 3). She used the third slide to argue that states with strong mitigation measures in place were more successful containing the disease, stating,\n\n[**Figure 2**](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/823916343/coronavirus-task-force-set-to-detail-the-data-that-led-to-extension-of-guideline): Slide 2 in the press briefing presentation.

And you can see what the result in Washington State and California is. But without the continuation for the next 30 days, anything could change.\u201d\n\nShe then displayed the slide shown in Figure 4 with data from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The slide illustrated the scope of the problem in New York and New Jersey relative to other areas. Dr. Birx showed these data to encourage community-by-community mitigation to prevent spikes in cases in other states.\n\n[**Figure 4**](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/823916343/coronavirus-task-force-set-to-detail-the-data-that-led-to-extension-of-guideline): Slide 4 in the press briefing presentation.

Display full size\n\nDr. Birx ended the formal presentation portion of the press briefing by showing and discussing the slide in Figure 5. It was meant to further support her contention that mitigation measures should be fully implemented. Dr. Birx stated,\n\n[**Figure 5**](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/823916343/coronavirus-task-force-set-to-detail-the-data-that-led-to-extension-of-guideline): Slide 5 in the press briefing presentation.

This is the case finding in Italy. And you can see that they\u2019re beginning to turn the corner in new cases. They\u2019re entering their fourth week of full mitigation and showing what is possible when we work together as a community, as a country, to change the course of this pandemic together.\u201d\n\nDr. Birx closed her portion of the presentation by asking the audience to continue existing mitigation measures for an additional 30 days. Dr. Fauci then came to the microphone to support her request. He warned the audience that the effects of mitigation might not be apparent immediately, and to not be discouraged if cases continued to rise in the short term. He finished his formal comments by stating the following about the government\u2019s recommended mitigation measures:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inconvenient from a societal standpoint, from an economic standpoint to go through this, but this is going to be the answer to our problems. So let\u2019s all pull together and make sure, as we look forward to the next 30 days, we do it with all the intensity and force that we can.\u201d\n\nAfter the formal presentation portion of the press briefing, Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci responded to questions from reporters in attendance. Several questions and responses are incorporated in the next three subsections, because they help reveal how statistical ideas and claims included in the formal presentation portion of the press briefing were interpreted by the audience.\n\n### 3.2 SKT and Statistical Models\nDuring the question-and-answer portion of the press briefing, reporters asked about the model projections Dr. Birx had provided (Figure 1). One reporter began this line of questioning by asking, \u201cJust to be clear, what is the projected death toll, should the people be reasonably good at following these mitigation measures?\u201d Dr. Birx responded,\n\n\u201cSo, of course, this is a projection, and it\u2019s a projection based on using very much what\u2019s happened in Italy and then looking at all the models. And so, as you saw on that slide, that was our real number\u2014that 100,000 to 200,000. And we think that that is the range. We really believe and hope every day that we can do a lot better than that\u2014because that\u2019s not assuming 100 percent of every American does everything that they\u2019re supposed to be doing. But I think that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nDr. Fauci added, \u201cThe modeling that Dr. Birx showed predicts that number that you saw\u2014we don\u2019t accept that number that that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be; we\u2019re going to be doing everything we can to get it even significantly below that.\u201d Later in the press briefing, questions about how model outputs would change in response to different inputs reemerged. Additional reporter questions of this type included:\n- What do the models suggest is on the low end if you have full mitigation?\n- If 100,000 is the number with full mitigation, how do you push it lower?\n- If we had started these practices sooner, could these models be different right now?\n\nThe persistence of these types of questions throughout the press briefing suggests that a different strategy for teaching the relationship between model inputs and outputs would have been desirable.\n\nOne strategy for teaching the relationship between model inputs and outputs would be to use dynamic, rather than static, graphical representations during the briefing. The emergence of dynamic representations can be considered one of the major developments in statistics pedagogy over the past two decades and an important part of the knowledge base for teaching the subject (Lee and Hollebrands Citation 2011). Rather than limiting graphical representations to the extreme cases of no mitigation and full mitigation (as in Figure 1), a dynamic graph would allow one to see how varying degrees of mitigation might change outcomes. Sliders assigned to parameters could be introduced to allow one to adjust inputs and observe the results. Users of the dynamic representation could then explore answers to questions like those that reporters posed about the impact of timing and extent of mitigation rather than having to rely upon just the two extreme ends of a continuum represented in static graphs (Figure 1). Knowing the educational possibilities of dynamic representations falls within the knowledge of content and teaching aspect of SKT.\n\nAs individuals interact with statistical models, it is important for them to know that such models are subject to change based on new data, conditions, and assumptions. Dr. Fauci acknowledged this during the press briefing, stating, \u201cI know my modeling colleagues are going to not be happy with me, but models are as good as the assumptions you put into them, and as we get more data, then you put it in and that might change.\u201d Although the comment rightly acknowledges degrees of uncertainty inherent in statistical models, it also indicates hesitation to question modelers\u2019 authority and conclusions. Dr. Birx\u2019s remarks earlier in the press briefing also contained several appeals to authority, as she named several prestigious institutions involved in the modeling process. It is generally not a sound teaching strategy to rely heavily on appeal to authority, because doing so can encourage passive consumption when active reflection is needed (Amit and Fried Citation 2005). Furthermore, it creates a perception that there are deterministic principles governing a phenomenon involving some uncertainty and variability. An important aspect of knowledge of content and students is to know that human beings have a tendency to favor deterministic explanations when stochastic ones are more appropriate (Rossman Citation 2008). Knowing this can help one anticipate the need to avoid framing stochastic situations deterministically.\n\nAn alternative to relying on appeal to authority would be to make the earlier-suggested dynamic model representation available online to the public, keep it up-to-date in terms of the newest available data, and encourage them to check it periodically to see how answers to their questions about mitigation have changed as more data became available. As answers to questions inevitably change in light of new data, the stochastic nature of the situation can become more apparent. This sort of continuous online interaction could foster a more authentic view of the degrees of variability, uncertainty, and predictability in the work of statistical modeling. Another potential benefit of such an approach would be allowing the public to see how their own actions may contribute to changes in the data upon which the model is based, therefore addressing the primary goal of the press briefing. This sort of arrangement could shift an appropriate amount of agency to the public to make projections and influence outcomes. Similar techniques have already been used to help television viewers engage with election data and make predictions. For example, many television networks use dynamic maps during elections to quickly zoom in on data from individual congressional districts and run \u201cwhat-if\u201d results scenarios based on changes in electoral vote inputs. Viewers are often invited to interact with the representation themselves online (e.g., https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/electoral-college-interactive-maps). Such techniques provide a glimpse at what may be possible for dynamic statistical model representations on television and online.\n\nAlthough it is somewhat intuitive to expect that various inputs will produce different outputs as one interacts with a dynamic representation, understanding reasons why the same input may produce different outputs in a statistical model is more complicated. For example, Figure 2 shows a wide band to characterize uncertainty inherent in a model. Most inputs along the horizontal axis correspond to not just a single output, but a range of probable ones. Interactions during the press briefing do little to reveal how the audience interpreted the band of uncertainty in Figure 2, but it seems reasonable to conjecture that few considered statistical variability as an underlying factor. Individuals tend to cite contextual, rather than statistical, sources when prompted to explain sources of uncertainty in predictions (Henriques and Oliveira Citation 2016). Qualitative explanations for contextual sources of uncertainty are likely to emerge before reasoning that leads to quantification of statistical variability (Manor, Ben-Zvi, and Aridor Citation 2014). Thorough understanding of statistical variability and its quantification can be difficult to attain even for undergraduates who have taken statistics and/or are preparing to teach it (Lovett and Lee Citation 2018).\n\nIt is extremely challenging to address gaps in understanding of statistical variability during a brief interaction. Perhaps the most viable way to help the public develop better understanding of statistical variation is to invest more time on repeated sampling and informal inference activities in schools (Pratt and Ainley Citation 2008). Of course, this would require finding additional instructional time in perpetually crowded curricula, but doing so could improve individuals\u2019 abilities to interpret model elements related to uncertainty such as the band shown in Figure 2. Health care professionals who partner with educators in developing such curricula would be in position to briefly remind the public of their experiences in school when helping them understand statistical variability in the context of health recommendations. Difficulties understanding statistical variability that persist even among those who have experienced enhanced curricula could be documented and used to continuously refine the curricula. Such ongoing interactions between health care professionals and curriculum developers could enhance the SKT of both groups.\n\n### 3.3 SKT and Disaggregation and Contextualization of Data\nThe projected death toll of 100,000 or more in the slides displayed in Figures 1 and 2 led to a discussion about how individual state data might contribute to the total. During the question-and-answer portion of the briefing, the following exchange occurred:\n\n**Reporter:** Can the country handle that in such a short period of time, within a couple of months? Fifty thousand a month (referring to projection of 100,000 deaths shown in Figure 1).\n\n**Dr. Fauci:** You know, it will be difficult. I mean, no one is denying the fact that we are going through a very, very difficult time right now. I mean, we\u2019re seeing what\u2019s happening in New York. That is really, really tough. And if you extrapolate that to the nation, that will be really tough. But that\u2019s what it is, Jim, and we\u2019re going to have to be prepared for that.\n\n**Dr. Birx:** Yeah, I think because the model\u2014that model that was from IHME (Figure 2)\u2014that\u2019s based and heavily ladened by the data that has come in from New York and New Jersey and Connecticut. So, you know, that can skew to a higher peak and more significant mortality. If all of the other states are able\u2014and all the other metro areas are able to hold that case number down, then it\u2019s a very different picture, but you have to predict on the data you have, which is heavily skewed to New York and New Jersey.\n\nLater in the press briefing, when Dr. Birx was asked if the New York and New Jersey infection patterns (Figure 3) were likely to occur in other states, she replied, \u201cThat\u2019s the piece that we\u2019re trying to prevent in New Orleans, in Detroit, in Chicago, and in Boston right now, and trying to make sure that each of those cities work more like California than the New York metro area.\u201d\n\nIn drawing contrasts among states, Drs. Birx and Fauci implicitly acknowledged the important statistical principal that \u201cdata are not just numbers, they are numbers with a context\u201d (Cobb and Moore Citation 1997, p. 801). In this case, they tried to convince the audience that it would be more desirable to create contextual circumstances across the United States that resembled those in California rather than those in New York. At one point, Dr. Birx tried to explain the differences in mitigation and timing across states, saying that officials in Washington state and California \u201creally talked to their communities and decided to mitigate\u201d a week or two in advance of New York and New Jersey. She believed this explained why the New York and New Jersey case graphs had large spikes (Figures 3 and 4) and Washington and California did not.\n\nThe connections between data and context Dr. Birx discussed led to mitigation measures in some states, but in other states, some governors quickly cast mitigation measures aside. Various political considerations likely influenced their choices. It is beyond the scope of this essay to review all of these considerations, but it seems likely that statistical reasoning also played a role. Historically, many enacted statistics curricula have suffered from lack of attention to forging connections between data and context (Jones and Tarr Citation 2010; Makar and Ben-Zvi Citation 2011); efforts to facilitate this type of reasoning in schools are relatively new (Pfannkuch Citation 2018). Those with this curricular knowledge, another aspect of SKT, can anticipate a need for a stronger attempt to prompt the audience to build statistical knowledge by \u201ccontinual shuttling backwards and forwards between thinking in the context sphere and the statistical sphere\u201d (Wild and Pfannkuch Citation 1999, p. 228). Engaging in this type of shuttling allows learners to make conjectures about why observed trends in data are happening and what they mean.\n\nThe spaghetti chart slides used during the press briefing (Figures 3 and 4) do provide starting points for reconciling data and context, as they disaggregated data by region. The main difficulty, however, is they do not readily provide information about the contextual dynamics of each region. Hyperlinking each spaghetti strand to a table and map with details about contextual dynamics for the region it represents may help. Each spaghetti strand could potentially be linked to tables containing information such as mitigation measures, timing of mitigation, types of mitigation, amount of testing, number of cases, number of deaths, maps showing where cases have been clustered, and any other information needed to understand the given region. The ability to link multiple types of representations, on a single screen, for seamless exploration, is another notable technology-based advance in statistics pedagogy over the past two decades (Mojica, Azmy, and Lee Citation 2019). Knowing of these linking abilities and their potential uses can be considered another aspect of knowledge of content and teaching within SKT. Putting an interactive representation of this nature online (as has been done with dynamic election maps) could make it readily accessible to viewers after the press briefing. Presenters at the press briefing could demonstrate how the display works, encourage others to explore further after the press conference, and make efforts to spread the representation via social media after the press briefing.\n\nAs the public examines statistics such as number of cases and number of deaths in a given region, learning supports to help them discern the affordances and limitations of each statistic would also be desirable. The activities of reading behind the data (Shaughnessy Citation 2007) and exploring limitations of statistics (Whitin Citation 2006) have also historically been neglected in many statistics curricula. Knowing this about the curriculum (an aspect of SKT) allows one to anticipate the need to remediate gaps in public knowledge. Relying on a single statistic, such as the number of cases documented, greatly weakens the conclusions one can draw from the data, yet it was a common tendency during the pandemic (Bronner Citation 2020). Considering complementary information such as number of deaths, hospitalizations, and amount of testing can help one draw more reliable conclusions. Using the press briefing to seed healthy skepticism about the amount of information any statistic on its own can provide and then encouraging online exploration of the earlier-recommended dynamic and linked representations may help the public appreciate important nuances of the situation.\n\n### 3.4 SKT and Experimental Study Design\nNear the conclusion of the press briefing, discussion turned toward vaccine development. A reporter asked, \u201cHow long does that normally take? Weeks? Months?\u201d Dr. Fauci replied \u201cat least months,\u201d explaining, \u201cthe drugs that you want to show in a good randomized clinical trial, at very best, they\u2019re going to take months.\u201d The concept of clinical trials emerged again when conversation turned toward development of treatments for those who were already infected. A reporter asked President Trump, \u201cGoing back to hydroxychloroquine, how many clinical trial tests, numerically, would you like to see before you put a stamp of approval on it? Because it\u2019s\u2014there are clinical trials being\u2014taking place around the world right now.\u201d Dr. Fauci responded for the President, prompting the following exchange:\n\n**Reporter:** Is there a number? How many cases would you like to see?\n\n**Dr. Fauci:** Yeah. That is an FDA decision and it really depends on a variety of factors. What I would like to see: a clinical trial that has a comparison to something that is comparable to what it means without the drug. I mean, I keep saying it. I say it all the time and I\u2019ll say it again: It\u2019s a controlled trial that compares it to something meaningful. When that\u2014\n\n**Reporter:** Are there particular trials that you\u2019re watching taking place around the world right now?\n\n**Dr. Fauci:** Well, there are a number of trials going on, not only in the United States, but also in other parts of the world. You know, right now, it\u2019s too early to make any determination, but I just want to get back to what I say all the time: The definitive way that you get an answer is by doing a randomized, controlled, clinical trial.\n\n**Reporter:** Dr. Fauci, on social distancing. Or Mr. President\u2014President Trump: You\u2019re talking about the chloroquine? Is that what you\u2019re talking about? In\u2014specifically, per the last question?\n\n**Reporter:** Yes. Hydroxychloroquine.\n\n**President Trump:** Yeah. No, there are trials going on. But there are also trials going on\u2014we\u2019re trying them on people that are now sick. That\u2019s a very important\u2014that\u2019s a very important trial, to me.\n\nAfter this exchange, the conversation turned to other matters.\n\nDuring the exchange above involving Dr. Fauci, news reporters, and President Trump, it was not clear that a shared understanding of the notion of \u201crandomized clinical trial\u201d existed. Reporters alluded to trials taking place around the world with those who were sick. At the time, these were generally observational rather than experimental studies, as indicated by Dr. Fauci\u2019s remarks. The initial reporter question to start the conversation pertained to the number of trials conducted rather than the manner in which they were done. Dr. Fauci then attempted to steer the conversation back to randomized clinical trials. After Dr. Fauci made this statement, though, President Trump seemed to return to something close to the reporter\u2019s original notion of trials, referring to those who were infected and receiving the medicine as a last resort. The entire exchange suggested that the parties involved may have been talking past one another when using the word trial. The knowledge of content and students aspect of SKT can help one anticipate these types of communication difficulties; words such as random and trial that have both well-established colloquial meanings as well as more precise statistical meanings can be particularly troublesome for learners (Kaplan, Fisher, and Rogness Citation 2010). Helping citizens and elected officials distinguish among these shades of meaning is particularly important when personal health and public policy decisions are at stake.\n\nExplicit language supports can help individuals distinguish between everyday and technical meanings of words. Existing research has begun to shed light on the types of language supports that may be most effective. Kaplan, Rogness, and Fisher (Citation 2014) found that a visual analogy contrasting statistical and colloquial meanings of the word random helped improve learners\u2019 understanding. They cautioned, however, that more research was needed on the potential widespread effectiveness of this type of intervention, recommending further research on how and why the changes they observed occurred. Pairing the word random with the phrase clinical trial would likely complicate the intervention further. However, once developed by further research, such interventions could become an important component of the knowledge of content and teaching aspect of SKT. The need for additional research on this aspect of SKT shows that this type of knowledge, just as medical knowledge, needs continuous development through empirical study. Although existing literature suggests aspects of SKT that would be beneficial to health care professionals, SKT is not a static construct ready for simple transmission to users. Both SKT and medicine are aspects of the knowledge base for health care professionals that need continuous empirical development.\n\n## 4 Implications for the Statistical Education of Health Care Professionals\nThe examples of SKT discussed above are summarized in Table 1. The entries in Table 1 likely represent just a small fraction of the aspects of SKT that are important to health care professionals. From this handful of examples, however, one can begin to recognize that the SKT aspects discussed in this essay can be useful for health care professionals beyond the specific press conference and situation that have been described. Hence, in this section, the potential broader applicability of the SKT elements summarized in Table 1 will be briefly considered.\n\n### 4.1 Knowledge of Content and Students for Health Care Professionals\nThe knowledge of content and students portion of Table 1 contains examples of common statistical learning issues related to the substance of the press briefing. The first challenge is to develop learners\u2019 abilities to distinguish between deterministic and stochastic phenomena. In this essay, the issue was considered in relation to interpretation of statistical model predictions. The ability to distinguish between deterministic and stochastic phenomena, however, underlies many other medical issues facing the public. For example, people may believe that medical tests provide deterministic results, overlooking possibilities of false positives and false negatives; it is then surprising for them to learn that a test advertised to have 99% accuracy can produce false positives at high rates like 25% under some circumstances (Lyublinskaya Citation 2005). Also, headlines and images in drug advertisements have the potential to lead the public to deterministic conclusions about drug efficacy (Wilkes, Doblin, and Shapiro Citation 1992). Advertisements about one drug being more effective than another can exploit colloquial deterministic meanings of effectiveness rather than explaining the more tentative and qualified statistical conclusions drawn in comparative studies.\n\nIt is important for health care professionals to understand the nature, origin, and prevalence of difficulties the public may have interpreting what they read and hear about medicine in everyday life so they can anticipate the need to provide appropriate learning supports. The examples above are by no means exhaustive. They are merely intended to illustrate that the need for SKT related to common patterns of thinking about statistics extends beyond the press briefing considered earlier. The essay examples are also intended to encourage research activity that can more fully characterize the SKT that is needed to educate the public at-large to foster their well-being. Further study of health care professionals in the act of trying to help others understand statistical information could produce a comprehensive inventory of the SKT needed to foster public well-being, just as studies of interactions in statistics classrooms have led to characterizations of the SKT needed by teachers (e.g., Pfannkuch Citation 2006; Burgess Citation 2011).\n\n### 4.2 Knowledge of Content and Teaching for Health Care Professionals\nKnowing the statistical thinking tendencies that exist among the public in regard to health issues is important, but not sufficient. It is also important to have teaching strategies that foster sound understanding. As summarized in the second row of Table 1, recent developments in statistics education technology offer options for doing so. In this essay, it was conjectured that dynamic and linked representations would have enhanced the instruction attempted during the press conference. Technology also offers additional options for addressing the learning difficulties mentioned in the previous section. In particular, many platforms afford the ability to conduct simulations that demonstrate frequencies of random outcomes (Garfield and Ben-Zvi Citation 2008). Examining such frequencies can help users develop sounder intuition about issues such as occurrence of false positives (Lyublinskaya Citation 2005) and the likely range of conclusions that might be drawn when an experiment comparing two treatments is replicated many times (Chance, Wong, and Tintle Citation 2016). Although interpreting simulations has its own challenges (Case and Jacobbe Citation 2018), there is growing evidence that simulation-based approaches are more effective than traditional approaches to teaching inference (Chance, Wong, and Tintle Citation 2016). As research on SKT related to health issues becomes more prevalent, it would be wise to interrogate and continuously improve all of the capabilities that statistics education technology currently has to offer to support the development of knowledge of content and teaching.\n\nMany attempts to provide technology-based learning supports for interpreting COVID-19 data and models did, in fact, emerge as the pandemic spread. For example, some websites used dynamic models that allowed for the alteration of inputs and outputs to help users see how the spread of a virus would change in response to different conditions (e.g., https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/, https://www.nctm.org/Classroom-Resources/Illuminations/Interactives/Pandemics-How-Are-Viruses-Spread/). Others provided dashboards and continuous updates on data pertaining to the spread of the virus (e.g., https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). No such tools, however, were featured during the press briefing considered in this essay. Statistical models and data were prominently featured during the briefing. However, the conduct of the press briefing, which was viewed by millions at a critical time in the spread of the pandemic, did not reflect a corresponding degree of attention to how individuals interpret models and data or contemporary learning supports to help the interpretation process. Given that a main goal of the press briefing was to use statistics to argue that government-created mitigation measures were necessary, a greater degree of attention to choosing appropriate teaching strategies would have been desirable. The need for SKT in this highly visible situation amplifies the need for health care professionals to have similar knowledge to support their private professional interactions with individuals as well; collectively, such smaller-scale interactions also have a large impact on overall public health.\n\n### 4.3 Knowledge of Curriculum for Health Care Professionals\nThe press briefing reflections also amplify the need for knowledge of statistics curricula among health care professionals. People are not blank slates; rather, they bring past experiences to bear in any situation. Experiences with school statistics curricula influence their interpretation of messages health care professionals attempt to convey. At present, it is important for health care professionals to know that many statistics curricula currently suffer from lack of attention to reconciling data and context, reading behind the data, and understanding limitations of individual statistical measures. The impacts of these deficits on the ability of the public to understand press briefing remarks were discussed earlier. Beyond the press briefing, many media stories omit information or make errors when reporting the contextual details of medical research studies (Chang Citation 2015) or intentionally sensationalize them (Shuchman and Wilkes Citation 1997). The public often struggles to interpret and scrutinize media stories in a sound manner (Adams et al. Citation 2017). Many current statistics curricula exacerbate the problem by not including opportunities for students to carefully interpret data in context. This makes it less likely that readers of media stories will probe the underlying contextual details of the research on which the stories are based. Knowing of such curriculum-induced challenges to helping individuals intelligently examine statistical claims is important for health care professionals charged with advising the public.\n\nOf course, there are even more pressing matters than knowledge of curriculum deficits; it is important to work toward sounder statistics curriculum strategies. K-12 curriculum improvements in statistics and probability have been uneven over the past several decades. Once reserved mainly for post-secondary study, probability and statistics gained momentum as strands running through the entire K-12 curriculum near the end of the twentieth century with the release of Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Citation 1989) and Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Citation 2000). More recently, however, Curriculum Focal Points (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Citation 2006) and the Common Core State Standards (Common Core State Standards Initiative Citation 2010) removed most probability and statistics content from the elementary grades. Some countries that once engaged young children in studying intuitive ideas of probability have removed probability from their early grades curricula (Langrall Citation 2018). The erratic starts and stops in curriculum reform in statistics and probability have made it difficult to achieve meaningful, lasting progress to help all citizens develop sound statistical and probabilistic reasoning. The COVID-19 pandemic vividly illustrates the pressing need for widespread statistically literacy, lending urgency to efforts to improve K-12 statistics and probability curricula.\n\nAt present, health care professionals need to know the nature of prevailing statistics curricula so they can anticipate extant gaps in statistical knowledge they are likely to encounter. Ideally, such knowledge would not only help them carry out their traditional professional responsibilities, but also prompt them to become partners in efforts to improve existing statistics curricula. Such partnerships should aim to enhance the public\u2019s statistical thinking abilities on a broad scale. Meaningful curriculum reform is a complex, gradual process, so efforts of this nature must be sustained over a long period of time to effect change. Recognizing the connections between the public\u2019s statistical literacy and their overall health and well-being may help foster the perseverance needed to develop and build long-lasting partnerships for curricular reform and further SKT research.\n\n## 5 Concluding Reflections\nIf one accepts the argument that SKT is an important aspect of the knowledge base for health care professionals, it is natural to ask how to include it in already overburdened medical school curricula. One possibility would be to purposefully develop SKT in already-required statistics courses. Models for teacher education provide strategies for addressing SKT and conventional statistics subject matter knowledge alongside one another in the same course (e.g., Groth Citation 2012; Green and Blankenship Citation 2013; Biehler, Frischemeier, and Podworny Citation 2018). One advantage of integrating SKT outcomes is that doing so provides opportunities to reflect on common statistical misunderstandings and how to remediate them. Potential (and practicing) health care professionals are not immune to such misunderstandings themselves. For example, Lang (Citation 2007) reported frequent errors in biomedical journals pertaining to interpretation and use of statistical significance, standard error, and standard deviation. Studying common statistical misunderstandings of others as part of required statistics coursework has the potential to make health care professionals more self-aware of the need to address such misunderstandings in their own thinking. Hence, in a carefully designed course, the study of SKT could actually enhance their subject matter knowledge rather than taking time away from its development.\n\nEven with improved coursework, however, it should be acknowledged that work demands make it difficult for health care professionals to stay abreast of all emerging research on the teaching and learning of statistics. In regard to the press briefing considered in this essay, for example, the technology-based pedagogical tools recommended to enhance the briefing did not exist when the two doctors presenting were in medical school. In high-stakes efforts to educate the public, a team approach is needed. The examples in this essay suggest that having statistics education specialists on such teams is essential so that common statistical thinking patterns are taken into account and addressed in the most effective ways possible. If the public is not convinced that mitigation measures are needed on the basis of empirical evidence, the only teaching tool that remains is appeal to authority. Relying on appeal to authority alone is not only unsound pedagogically; in a democratic society it can, and did, cause systematic backlash against the recommended measures. As the so-called \u201cpandemic playbooks\u201d in various countries around the world are scrutinized and revised in the wake of COVID-19, democratic countries would be especially remiss to ignore the role of statistics education in their observed successes and failures during the pandemic.\n\nJust as enhanced SKT can help improve medical education, recognizing it as necessary for medical education can help improve SKT research. To remain viable, both SKT and medicine require continually growing and evolving bodies of knowledge based on empirical data. Partnerships between statistics education researchers and medical researchers would be mutually beneficial. For example, as suggested earlier, statistics education researchers might analyze the clinical practice of doctors by using tools that have been developed to examine teachers\u2019 SKT in conventional classroom settings (e.g., Pfannkuch Citation 2006; Burgess Citation 2011). As another example, technology-based teaching tools could be examined for their effectiveness in health care contexts and then refined in response to peoples\u2019 thinking about them; such investigations could benefit from methods and tools developed for design-based research in statistics (Bakker and van Eerde Citation 2015) that allow researchers to develop and improve the tools in a bootstrapping fashion. This essay only scratches the surface in providing direction for partnerships between statistics education researchers and medical researchers. The conjectures offered herein provide potential starting points for such efforts, but many other focus areas are ripe for identification and empirical study.\n\nIn closing, it is useful to revisit Shulman\u2019s (Citation 1987) original characterization of pedagogical content knowledge as the \u201cspecial amalgam of content and pedagogy that is uniquely the province of teachers, their own special form of professional understanding\u201d (p. 8). In light of the examples offered in this essay, one might question whether such knowledge should really be just \u201cuniquely the province of teachers.\u201d Or, if one holds to the original characterization, it must be acknowledged that health care professionals need to be considered statistics teachers in their own right. In any case, we must find ways to better prepare them to carry out their teaching functions and provide extra support as needed, especially in large-scale, high-stakes scenarios such as COVID-19. Improving society\u2019s capacity to more effectively teach statistical thinking before and during situations where public health hangs in the balance is paramount.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nEntrepreneurship is at the heart of new developments that often lead to the creation of new industries. This study examines the origins of the canning industry via the experiences of three of its earliest entrepreneurs: Edward Wright, William Numsen, and Thomas Kensett II. The narrative examines key aspects of the industry\u2019s context including the growth in demand for preserved foods, the resources of the Chesapeake region, and the development of food preservation technology. Using the five characteristics of entrepreneurial processes, the importance of entrepreneurs in the development of the economic growth of Baltimore\u2019s early canning industry is examined. Each founder exhibited entrepreneurial characteristics in different ways. One failed in his efforts; the other two succeeded in developing businesses that endured into the next century. The study reveals that using entrepreneurial processes does not guarantee success, and that there are various paths to success. An entrepreneurial multiplier effect was also evident in the growth of firms producing supplies and equipment for canners. Using an entrepreneurial lens offers a closer insight into the development of firms and their industries. Some remaining unanswered questions as well as avenues for future studies are discussed.\n\nKEYWORDS: Canning industry, entrepreneurial processes, industry growth, Chesapeake region, Baltimore city, food preservation\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Dr. C\u00e9line Carayon for encouraging me to pursue this project and for her helpful comments on early drafts. Dr. Hillary Hoffman and two anonymous reviewers of this journal provided helpful suggestions in revisions of the manuscript.\n\nDisclosure of potential conflicts of interest\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of regulation\u2010driven trade barriers on export entrepreneurship in a panel of 60 countries between 2006 and 2014. The paper finds robust evidence that unfavorable trade regulations significantly reduce export entry rate and export entry density (two critical measures of export entrepreneurship) by increasing the time and cost associated with documentary and customs compliance procedures. These findings support the hypothesis that less conducive business regulations are an important domestic supply constraint which impedes export entrepreneurship by increasing trade costs. In addition, the paper finds that the magnitude of the negative relationship between export entrepreneurship and regulation\u2010driven trade barriers is significantly more pronounced in countries with poor governance quality. Two measures of governance quality (i.e., political stability and rule of law) are shown to be relatively more significant in aiding favorable trade regulations that promote export entrepreneurship. Furthermore, a reduction in regulation\u2010driven trade barriers has a positive impact on net entry rate and survival rates of first\u2010, second\u2010 and third\u2010year exporters, and high\u2010quality governance institutions significantly increase the magnitude of this positive relationship.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTFor the past 100 years, the Supreme Court ruling in the case of Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, from 1919 has stood as a landmark case due to the Court\u2019s creation of a \u201cClear and Present Danger\u201d standard of freedom of speech. Through the vehicle of the Clear and Present Danger measure, the Court reconsidered that the degree of freedom for inflammatory rhetoric could be legally permissible until the point that realistic danger of harm or illegal action might occur. One century after this ruling, this paper examines the unprecedentedly divisive and uncivil public rhetoric of a US President, Donald J. Trump. Through a descriptive analysis summarizing the characteristics of President Trump\u2019s rhetoric, we contend that Trump generates a level of dangerous Presidential communication not publicly expressed by previous Presidents that arguably could be considered to overstep the limits of free expression set forth by the courts.KEYWORDS: Clear and Present Danger, president Trump, presidential Rhetoric, first Amendment, freedom of Speech\n",

Using a two\u2010sector dynamic general equilibrium model, we obtained two implications of higher regulation on small firms that have yet to be empirically tested in the published literature. First, as regulations increase, small firms\u2019 share of employment shrinks. Second, as regulations rise, small firms\u2019 share of total output falls. Using a panel of industry\u2010specific US regulatory restrictions, we found that a 10% increase in federal regulations was associated with an approximate 0.8% reduction in small firms\u2019 share of industry employment and a nearly 1.5% decline in small firms\u2019 share of industry output.\n",

This child\u2019s dread-charged awe before the Stranger brings into focus the tension fundamental to our lives\u2014our being torn between openness to the unprecedented future and the desire to protect ourselves from it. Dialoguing with Loewald, Freud, and Heidegger, I consider the radical anxiety the child experiences when exposed to the dreadful not\u2014the absence of the needed. Dialoguing with Aristotle, I discuss how wonder draws the child into harmonious play with alterities that are intelligible to her. However, from the beginning the child is surrounded by alterities whose transcendence overwhelms her. We recoil from such transcendence because it fills us with dread, are drawn to it because it fills us with awe. Dread-charged awe in the face of the other, especially the human Other, is, I argue, the quintessential human experience. Additional information Notes on contributors Jerome Miller Jerome Miller, Ph.D., is the author of The Way of Suffering and In the Throe of Wonder; he also co-edited and contributed to Sobering Wisdom, an anthology of philosophical essays on Twelve Step spirituality.

        "abstract": "In this article, I argue for a chronotopic-scalar system of images and resolutions in the analysis of language use in general and multilingual practices in particular. Drawing on data from Iranian Azerbaijanis, I argue that availability and accessibility of linguistic/semiotic resources, and their categorizations as languages or language varieties, are constrained by participants\u2019 chronotopization histories. That is, the scaled images participants develop through socialization about different time\u2013space frames and the peoples, relations, discourses, and resources therein guide their language use both from and about particular contexts. I discuss the utility of spatiotemporal understandings of repertoires of resources and normalcies in capturing the variability, dynamicity, and complexity of semiotic practices and also in addressing the controversies among scholars regarding the \u2018realness\u2019 of languages and hybridity of multilingual practices. Through decentralizing language(s) and foregrounding context(s) and contextualization, I argue, the chronotope enables us to analyze not only social actors\u2019 hybrid utilization of semiotic resources in meaning-making processes, but also their language ideologies and language-ideological practices, which rely heavily on the perceptions of languages as discrete systems.\n",

        "abstract": "Despite the benefits of using smart speakers, serious privacy concerns have been raised, particularly due to their constantly listening microphones. Given the mixture of the advantages and risks deciding whether to use them is not an easy matter, casting a doubt about sustainable growth and development of smart speakers. Using a sample of 559 users in South Korea and the U.S., we empirically investigated the dilemma of users seeking to adopt smart speakers. The results revealed users\u2019 perceived usefulness and enjoyment positively influenced the intention to adopt smart speakers. No direct effect of perceived ease of use was found but this effect was completely mediated by perceived usefulness and enjoyment. Perceived enjoyment was found to be twice as strong as perceived usefulness in determining the usage intention, confirming the hedonic aspect of smart speakers. Conversely, perceived privacy risks were shown to be a significant negative factor. This negative impact was significantly stronger in the U.S. than in South Korea. We could infer that the more mature the stage of acceptance of smart speakers, the greater the sensitivity of users to privacy risks. Lastly, in the South Korean sample, we found that the perceived usefulness could reduce the negative impact of perceived risks on the intention. to adopt smart speakers.\n",

        "abstract": "With the backdrop of the utility of grit at the individual level, speculation has begun to circulate that grit may exist as an organizational level phenomenon. To explore this potential construct, this study used an exploratory, qualitative research design. This study explored grit at the organizational level by interviewing leaders\u2019 perceptions of what may be a culture of organizational grit. Participants included 14 U.S. military officers. Seven themes emerged relative to the research question: \u201cWhat do U.S. military officers perceive as a culture of organizational grit?\u201d Themes included professional pride, team unity, resilience-determination, mission accomplishment, core values, growth mindset, and deliberate practice. This study indicated that a culture of organizational grit is likely a combination of converging organizational elements. Overall, findings indicate that there may be a culture of organizational grit in the military and at the least, more research examining the concept is warranted.\n",

The first part of this experiment utilizes high-throughput experimentation techniques to reinforce, explore, and extend fundamental concepts that are represented in the classroom, including the use of air-free Schlenk techniques and heteronuclear NMR analysis. The second component challenges students to evaluate their results to design, set up, and perform a preparative-scale Buchwald\u2013Hartwig amination. Finally, students purify and isolate their products using column chromatography allowing them to fully characterize their target molecules through a variety of analytical techniques. This experiment represents one of the final experiments performed in the fourth-year undergraduate chemistry curriculum and serves as a capstone learning experience for students.\n",

We develop a model that illustrates protections from mangroves and coastal elevation and estimate the impacts of cyclones on coastal economic activity. We find that higher elevation or expansive mangroves alone shelter economic activity from \u201cindirect\u201d cyclone exposure whereas economic activity is only protected from \u201cdirect\u201d cyclone exposure in high elevation communities with expansive mangroves. Our global mapping reveals that the majority of these \u201csafe havens\u201d are in upper middle-income countries but are used by populations in lower middle-income countries.\n",

Emotional intelligence (EI) is also associated with effective leadership and ethical behavior; thus, there has been a surge in studies that assessed the link between EI and servant leadership. Nevertheless, the empirical landscape of this relationship is mixed and fragmented. We undertook a meta\u2010analysis to clarify this literature and found that (a) EI has a significant positive relationship with servant leadership (\u03c1\u0305\u0302\u00a0=\u00a0.57); (b) the relationship between EI and servant leadership is stronger in studies having a lower percentage of well\u2010educated subjects, in low power distance cultures, and in high institutional collectivism cultures; and (c) We were unable to find sufficient evidence to support moderating effects of the relationship between EI and servant leadership for gender (male\u2010dominated and female\u2010dominated studies), age (between young and old subjects), for self\u2010report versus follower\u2010report of servant leadership, and across different scales of servant leadership.\n",

        "abstract": "Castration-resistant prostate cancer can be treated with the antiandrogen enzalutamide, but responses and duration of response are variable. To identify genes that support enzalutamide resistance, we performed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen in the bone-homing, castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line, C4-2B. We identified 11 genes (TFAP2C, CAD, SPDEF, EIF6, GABRG2, CDC37, PSMD12, COL5A2, AR, MAP3K11, and ACAT1) whose loss resulted in decreased cell survival in response to enzalutamide. To validate our screen, we performed transient knockdowns in C4-2B and 22Rv1 cells and evaluated cell survival in response to enzalutamide. Through these studies, we validated three genes (ACAT1, MAP3K11, and PSMD12) as supporters of enzalutamide resistance in vitro. Although ACAT1 expression is lower in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer samples versus primary prostate cancer samples, knockdown of ACAT1 was sufficient to reduce cell survival in C4-2B and 22Rv1 cells. MAP3K11 expression increases with Gleason grade, and the highest expression is observed in metastatic castration-resistant disease. Knockdown of MAP3K11 reduced cell survival, and pharmacologic inhibition of MAP3K11 with CEP-1347 in combination with enzalutamide resulted in a dramatic increase in cell death. This was associated with decreased phosphorylation of AR-Serine650, which is required for maximal AR activation. Finally, although PSMD12 expression did not change during disease progression, knockdown of PSMD12 resulted in decreased AR and AR splice variant expression, likely contributing to the C4-2B and 22Rv1 decrease in cell survival. Our study has therefore identified at least three new supporters of enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells in vitro.\n",

This study explores how parents conceptualized advocacy roles. Eleven parents of TGNC children age 13 and under completed semi-structured phone interviews. Ten parents considered themselves advocates, with digital advocacy being the most common. Advocacy motivations centered around parental concerns. Parents were divided on whether advocacy helped or had no impact on the parent-child relationship. The largest-shared concern was over the right to privacy. These findings have implications for mobilizing parents of TGNC youth as advocates.\n\n**Keywords:** Transgender, youth, gender non-conforming, advocacy, parenting\n\n## Acknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Christina Cole, Sabrina Dixon, Deija Spencer, and Juliet Vapsva, who assisted with this research, and the parents who were willing to share their stories with us.\n\n## Declaration of interest\nThe authors have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that would have influenced the work reported in this paper.\n\n**Notes** 1 The term TGNC is used to be consistent with the general body of psychological literature. However, non-binary, gender-expansive, and gender-creative people also fall under this umbrella.\n\n## Additional information\n**Funding:** This work was supported by the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues Grants-in-Aid program awarded to the first author, and the Salisbury University Office of Graduate Studies and Research. Domonique Bush is now at the University of New Haven.\n",

        "abstract": "Almost no research exists examining the relationship between body-esteem and sexual victimization experience in adulthood. The current study contributes to the literature by examining body-esteem based on type of sexual victimization experience (i.e., none, sexual contact, attempted sexual coercion, sexual coercion, attempted rape, rape). Participants included undergraduate women ( n\u2009=\u2009750) who completed the Body-Esteem Scale ( Franzoi & Shields, 1984 ) and the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization ( Koss et al., 2007 ), and had either no history of sexual victimization experience or experience within the past year. Women with no sexual victimization experience did not differ from women with sexual contact experience, but both groups reported higher body-esteem than women with coercion, attempted coercion, and rape experience. These three latter groups did not differ from one another, but each reported lower body-esteem than women with attempted rape experience, who reported higher body-esteem than those with no experience. Findings are preliminary but suggest that body-esteem may be negatively associated with some types of sexual victimization experience (attempted and completed coercion, rape), but not others (sexual contact, attempted rape), and escaping rape may increase positive feelings toward one\u2019s body.\n",

Using data from the 2000\u20132019 seasons, results indicate that WNBA teams are more likely to lose after they have been eliminated from postseason playoffs regardless of the gender of the coach or general manager. Evidence of tanking is concentrated in seasons after the WNBA made a draft lottery change in 2015, which was intended to reduce tanking.\n",

It explores how two parts of the author\u2019s identity (being a mother, and being a daughter whose mother died) teach her to hear cinema anew along with her students. By extension, it builds upon other sound scholarship (especially the work of Michel Chion), by stressing that every person\u2019s experiences leads them to rehear all cinema with meaningful results. In this chapter, the author first draws from her experiences of motherhood while teaching the sound track of Babies (2010). Second, she reflects on witnessing her mother\u2019s death in relation to teaching the sound track of a death scene from Ten Canoes (2006). Third, the author connects being in the presence of her mother\u2019s silent body with teaching a conversation from An Examined Life (2008), featuring queer theorist Judith Butler and disabled artist-activist Sunara Taylor.\n",

        "abstract": "Habitats with spatial variation in food availability, predation risk, and hunting pressure allow us to study how animals resolve the trade\u2010off between food searching and predator avoidance. We investigated the influence of food availability, predation risk, and the perceived predation risk on habitat use by a primate living under high hunting pressure, the yellow\u2010breasted capuchin monkeys,Sapajus xanthosternos, at Una Biological Reserve (ReBio Una). We hypothesized that the hunting pressure occurring in the capuchins' home range would favor predator avoidance to the detriment of searching for food. We characterized a set of covariates related to resource availability (fruit and invertebrate biomasses, feeding on dispersed and clumped food items, sleeping sites), perceived predation risk (alarm calls given to terrestrial and aerial predators, silent group movement, and vigilance behavior), and actual predation risk (evidence of hunting) and estimated their effects on how one group of capuchin monkeys uses its habitat. The group divides its time among three major forest types within their home range: agroforest, mature, and secondary. Our results suggest that the actual and perceived risk of hunting by humans, as well as the perceived predation risk by both terrestrial and aerial predators, were significant determinants of capuchin monkeys' space use. Yellow\u2010breasted capuchin monkeys' space use was negatively related to the risk of hunting by humans (actual evidence and silent behavior), the perceived risk of predation by both aerial and terrestrial predators, and the presence of sleeping sites. Capuchin monkeys' use of space was not related to the biomass of fruits in the habitat, and the biomass of invertebrates had a very low positive effect. We confirmed our prediction that in a habitat with high hunting pressure, the risk of predation, both perceived and actual, had a more significant impact on how yellow\u2010breasted capuchins used space than did food availability.\n",

        "abstract": "Phytoplankton biomass is routinely estimated using relationships between cell volume and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content that have been defined using diverse plankton that span orders of magnitude in size. Notably, volume has traditionally been estimated with geometric approximations of cell shape using cell dimensions from planar two-dimensional (2D) images, which requires assumptions about the third, depth dimension. Given advances in image processing, we examined how cell volumes determined from three-dimensional (3D), confocal images affected established relationships between phytoplankton cell volume and C and N content. Additionally, we determined that growth conditions could result in 30\u201340% variation in cellular N and C. 3D phytoplankton cell volume measurements were on average 15% greater than the geometric approximations from 2D images. Volume method variation was minimal compared to both intraspecific variation in volumes (~30%) and the 50-fold variation in elemental density among species. Consequently, C:vol and N:vol relationships were unaltered by volume measurement method and growth environment. Recent advances in instrumentation, including those for at sea and autonomous applications can be used to estimate plankton biomass directly. Going forward, we recommend instrumentation that permits species identification alongside size and shape characteristics for plankton biomass estimates.\n",

PASCO scientific\u2019s Smart Cart, in combination with student-owned smartphones and free apps, has opened a new universe of low-cost experiments that have traditionally required cumbersome and expensive equipment. In this paper, we demonstrate the simplicity, convenience, and cost-savings achieved by replacing a plethora of traditional motion sensors, wires, interface boards, and other equipment clutter with the smart cart, PASPORT\u00ae High Sensitivity Light Sensor, and the free SPARKvue\u00ae app by carrying out diffraction measurements of light with a single as well as double slit. Rylander and Miller reported a similar experiment but with an ordinary laboratory cart and a motion sensor to extract the precise position of the light sensor. The use of the smart cart in this report obviates the need for using a motion sensor and the laborious extraction of the position data.\n",

However, in-class role-play activities have the potential to create scheduling dilemmas. Mandatory, internal role-play competitions are proposed as a solution to these logistical issues while providing additional professional development benefits to all participants. Results of a repeated-measures study also support that a role-play is more than a tool to refine sales presentation skills, but when administered as an internal competition it not only improves in-class logistics but also positively influence students\u2019 intent to pursue a sales career.\n\nDisclosure Statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\n\nNotes\n1 In a normal class period of 1 hour and 15 minutes an executive can only play a buyer or judge for 5 students or less. During this time the executives do not get to interact with other students.\n",

This review article examines the role of the two arguments in these discussions of Regan and animal rights and argues that effective animal advocacy will require more critical attention to social context\u2014in particular, to how well the arguments\u2019 assumptions describe our world and to how the arguments are likely to be used to reinforce existing injustices.\n",

Why do nonstate armed groups seek the status of sole representatives?, What strategies do they employ to achieve the status of sole representatives?, Is the status merely symbolic, or does it fetch tangible benefits? These research questions are explored by treating Sri Lanka\u2019s LTTE as a case study. Primary and secondary data formed the basis of the analysis. The LTTE used three strategies to achieve a hegemonic disposition within the Tamil community. They are: (1) elimination of rival groups, (2) incorporation of some groups, and (3) battlefield efficacy. The rebels used the claim of sole representation to ensure bilateral talks with the government, get the ban on it lifted, and control the proposed interim administrative structure. The strategy worked to a certain extent, but at least partially contributed to its downfall in 2009.\n\nDisclosure Statement\nThe author has no conflict of interest\n\nNotes\n1.

Courses cover a wide array of diverse topics and can vary in terms of effort level and pedagogical approach. They have evolved from an experiment in global course interactions to offering college credit, professional certifications, professional development credits, college course supplemental material, incorporation in college campus education, and career gap\u2013specific courses while reaching as many learners as possible. Most are associated with universities and taught by professors, produced via a partnership of universities with online learning platforms, such as edX\u00ae and Coursera. A variety of educational tools can be incorporated, such as interactive modules, video lectures, reference materials, assessments, collaborative lessons, discussion boards, and peer-reviewed assignments. Newer MOOCs feature chatbots and adaptive algorithm models that adjust to learners' prior knowledge and question responsiveness. They can be easily accessed by anyone, provided they have an internet connection, language proficiency (most are only available in English), and computer literacy (Setia et al., 2019). Many MOOCs offer an audit track, which provides access to all course materials for a limited time except graded assignments; they are typically free but learners are unable to earn a \u201ccertificate\u201d under this option. To earn a verified certificate, learners pay a fee and must complete specified assessments, discussions, and/or other assigned learning activities.\n\nMillions of learners of various ages, backgrounds, interests, and goals typically enroll in these courses. As a form of e-learning, MOOCs continue to emerge as a particularly valuable strategy to address some of the training challenges experienced in developing countries by supporting efficient content delivery, decreasing costs, and increasing access (Liyanagunawardena & Aboshady, 2018). MOOCs have been shown to significantly improve outreach regarding public health concerns, as well as providing necessary training for health care professionals and the general public. The most recent report presented at the edX Virtual Forum (2020) documents >35 million learners with 110 million unique enrollments spanning 196 countries. Furthermore, MOOCs are particularly suited for addressing health topics while attracting global learners from low-resource contexts (Barteit et al., 2019). Currently, health and medicine are estimated to account for only a small percentage of MOOCs; topics have included nutrition, stress management, alternative therapies, mental health, ethics, global health, and health care leadership. Other courses are more disease- or condition-specific, such as hypertension, menopause, and pediatric injuries, as well as HIV and addiction. However, what seems to be substantially lacking are courses focused on conditions related to aging and issues impacting older adults.\n\nAs part of a concerted effort to address this dearth of gero-focused content, two MOOCs were launched by Salisbury University's School of Nursing in conjunction with USMx, an initiative through the University System of Maryland's William E. Kirwan Center for Academic Innovation (access  https://www.edx.org/course/overview-management-ofparkinsons-disease-2;  https://www.edx.org/course/alzheimers-disease-dementia-care). The two courses, titled Overview of Parkinson's Disease & Management and Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Care, were purposely designed to appeal to lay persons and caregivers, as well as health care professionals working with these patient populations. These courses include a variety of teaching modalities to enhance learner engagement, such as introductory/summary videos for each of the five modules, check your knowledge questions, web links, embedded visuals/videos, as well as video interviews with a person with Parkinson's disease and an Alzheimer's care-giver, respectively, followed by reflective discussion. The response to these self-paced, gero-focused offerings has been overwhelmingly positive, and data show the goal of reaching a wide audience with varying skills was exceeded within the first year. Collectively, there are >12,000 learners and growing, reaching more than 140 countries, with the United States only making up 15% to 20% of the enrolled population. Of these learners who self-reported demographic information for the two courses, approximately 65% are female and 35% are male and median age is 28 years. Approximately 26% have a high school diploma or less, and 24% have an advanced degree. Although these MOOCs, which launched in late 2019/early 2020, likely experienced heightened interest due to the COVID-19\u2013induced lockdown worldwide, the far-reaching nature of these courses as a cost-effective way to introduce a widespread audience to pertinent gerontological topics of interest is markedly clear.\n\nEven with their growing popularity, scholarly debate continues regarding benefits versus concerns when offering free and open content to an international audience. Limitations can include low-quality or non-engaging instruction, passive learning, course difficulty, and low average completion rates despite free content (Setia et al., 2019). High drop-out rates remain a much-criticized issue (Chan et al., 2019). Suggested strategies for improving participation and completion rates while enhancing perceived value would include offering courses of shorter duration and incorporating good-quality media. Furthermore, advertising courses through multiple credible channels (including social media platforms) can spread awareness about e-learning opportunities (Setia et al., 2019). Incentives can include offering certificates, credits, or professional credit; providing learning support and learner feedback; and using data to analyze drop-out points to drive course improvements (Chan et al., 2019).\n\nMOOCs can provide a free and accessible way for learners to be exposed to new topics or disciplines while providing a forum to stimulate new interests and ideas. They can serve as an effective and efficient method to provide education regarding health topics while creating a diverse and interactive community of global learners. MOOCs that address issues specific to the geriatric population can go beyond disease-oriented topics to those that explore broader concerns related to aging, such as polypharmacy, health promotion, transitions in care, end-of-life decision making, and the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in optimizing care outcomes. Although MOOCs can be resource-intensive to develop, the rewards of educating a global audience can be particularly satisfying. High-quality MOOCs developed by knowledgeable faculty and/or expert health care professionals can provide a learning environment where gerontological nurses and other health care providers, as well as lay persons/caregivers from various geographic regions, cultures, and backgrounds, can connect and share experiences. Nursing faculty, in collaboration with practicing gerontological nurses, have the opportunity to provide cutting edge MOOCs to not only enhance learning among students and health care peers to enhance practice, but also inform the global community at large about pertinent geriatric topics.\n",

        "abstract": "As COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, health researchers and practitioners have focused attention on identifying the factors that may help to shape health-protective behaviors, protecting individual health and well-being, and helping to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This study explores the potential role of self-leadership and psychological capital (PsyCap) as key cognitive resources for shaping health-protective behaviors. Using multiple theoretical frameworks (social cognitive theory, psychological resources theory, and the health belief model), this paper develops and tests a hypothesized serial mediation model in which PsyCap and coping self-efficacy mediate the relationship between self-leadership and health-protective behaviors including hand washing, wearing face masks, and social distancing. Results suggest that PsyCap and coping self-efficacy mediate the positive relationship between self-leadership and health-protective behaviors. These results yield valuable insights regarding the usefulness of self-leadership and PsyCap as cognitive resources for shaping health-protective behaviors and for possible self-leadership and PsyCap interventions, potentially tailored to at-risk populations, which should have practical benefits for both the current and future pandemics and health crises.\n",

        "abstract": "Tidal processes regulating sediment accretion rates and vegetated platform erosion in tidal systems strongly affect salt marsh evolution. A balance between erosion and deposition in a restored salt marsh is crucial for analyzing restoration strategies to be adopted within a natural context. Marsh morphology is also coupled with tidal mudflats and channel networks and this makes micro-tidal systems crucial for a detailed assessment of restoration interventions. Here, we present a methodological approach for monitoring channel morphodynamics and vegetation variations over a time frame of six years in a low tidal energy salt marsh of the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island (Maryland, USA). The project is a restoration site where sediment dredged from the shipping channels in the upper Chesapeake Bay is used to restore a tidal marsh habitat in mid-Chesapeake Bay. Aerial surveys with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) have been performed for the high-resolution mapping of a small tidal system. Flight missions were planned to obtain a Ground Sample Distance (GSD) of 2 cm. Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) algorithms have been used to reconstruct the 3D geometry of the site. The mapping of channel morphology and an elevation assessment on the mudflat were performed using orthomosaics, Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) and GNSS survey. The results highlight that the workflow adopted in this pilot work is suitable to assess the geomorphological evolution over time in a micro-tidal system. However, issues were encountered for salt marsh due to the presence of dense vegetation. The UAV-based photogrammetry approach with GNSS RTK ground surveys can hence be replicated in similar sites all over the world to evaluate restoration interventions and to develop new strategies for a better management of existing shorelines.\n",

        "abstract": "This study's objective is to examine the role of resilience in the dynamic between academic burnout and psychological distress using a sample of US undergraduate accounting majors. It extends prior research\u2014that is, Garc\u00eda\u2010Izquierdo et al. (2018), who examine these relationships using a sample of Spanish nursing students. For this study, a survey instrument was concurrently administered to 443 accounting majors at four geographically dispersed universities. Two alternative models are tested. The first model positions resilience as an exogenous predictor, and dimensions of academic burnout antecedent to psychological distress. The results indicate a significant negative association between resilience, psychological distress, and each of the three academic burnout dimensions. In addition, emotional exhaustion and academic inefficacy have a significant positive association with psychological distress. The alternative model positions psychological distress antecedent to each of the academic burnout dimensions. The results indicate that resilience has a significant negative association with psychological distress, cynicism, and academic inefficacy, but not emotional exhaustion. Moreover, psychological distress has significant positive associations with each academic burnout dimension. In the alternative model specification, resilience is also found to moderate the association between psychological distress and academic inefficacy. This single moderating effect notwithstanding, the findings suggest that the primary role of resilience is that of a compensatory mechanism by acting as an independent exogenous predictor of distress and burnout.\n",

        "abstract": "This paper explores how trust in formal information sources (government and media) and informal information sources (interpersonal) about COVID-19 influences compliance with preventive measures. This cross-sectional study uses convenience sampling of 478 adult participants. Data analyses using structural equation modeling with multigroup comparisons examine hypothesized relationships between trust in information sources and preventative behaviors and social distancing. Results suggest that understanding of COVID-19 causes is related to trust in formal information sources, but not to trust in informal information. Self-efficacy for prevention is related to trust in informal information sources, but not to trust in formal information sources. Worry about contracting COVID-19 is related to trust in formal information sources, but not to informal ones. Engaging in preventive measures is linked to both self-efficacy for prevention and worry, while social distancing was related only to worry. These findings have important implications for public health policy guidelines centered on clear and truthful media messages. The findings also facilitate comparative analyses of reactions to information sources across a decade of evolving attitudes toward media and government, between two cultures (Hong Kong vs. the USA), and between two different global pandemics.\n",

        "abstract": "Arterial stiffness is an indicator of disease and is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events. There have been inconsistencies from previous investigations examining the effect of resistance training on arterial stiffness in female participants.\n\nObjective\nThis study was conducted to examine the effect of two resistance training models on arterial stiffness in females.\n\nHypothesis\nWe tested the hypothesis that 11 weeks of either high-intensity or high-volume resistance training would not increase indices of arterial stiffness in young, healthy females.\n\nMethods\n24 female, untrained college students aged 18-22 years were randomized into one of three groups: control (CON) group (n = 8), high-intensity resistance exercise (HI) group (n = 8), and high-volume resistance exercise (HV) group (n = 8). Subjects randomized to resistance training groups were required to perform strength training exercises three to five days a week for 11 weeks. The exercise regimen consisted of 2-3 sets of 3-8 repetitions (80-90% of 1-repetition maximum (1 RM)) for the HI group and 3-4 sets of 10-15 repetitions (50%-70% of 1 RM) for the HV group. All subjects were instructed to continue their normal diet and avoid cardiovascular exercise during the study.\n\nResults\nFollowing the intervention, there was a significant increase in carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (C-F PWV) (6.39\u00b10.73 to 8.4\u00b12.31; P < 0.05) and carotid radial (C-R) PWV (9.77\u00b11.74 to 12.58\u00b12.09; P < 0.05) in the CON group only. Both CON and HI groups had significantly decreased central pulse pressure (cPP) (-15.3\u00b112.4 vs. -13.11\u00b112.0 percent change; P < 0.05), respectively. Both the HI and HV groups increased their maximum squat (36.6\u00b17.9 vs.41.3\u00b131.8 percent change; P < 0.05), bench press (34.4\u00b112.6 vs. 23.4\u00b111.1 percent change; P < 0.05), and seated row (22.0\u00b112.6 vs. 21.9\u00b112.5 percent change; P < 0.05), respectively.\n\nConclusion\nOur findings support the use of resistance training exercise without undue impact on vascular compliance in healthy, young females.\n",

        "abstract": "Student evaluations of teaching are ubiquitous in higher education; however, most prior research has focused on the numeric ratings, with little systematic attention given to the qualitative comments. In this study, written comments were collected as part of the regular evaluation of a community health nursing course over four semesters. Taken as a whole, student comments were strikingly consistent and mostly negative. Students emphasized the authority of the textbook and framed the course as preparation for the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX). Instructor efforts to focus on critical analysis of social issues were met with confusion, suspicion, and resistance. Student comments were further analyzed in relation to 3 levels of discourse: the student/teacher level, the nursing\u2010education level, and the social\u2013historical level. For each level, the comments reveal problems, but not the ones suggested by a conventional reading of student evaluations. If students and teachers have conflicting expectations about goals and methods for learning, formal student evaluations may be less useful as a measure of teaching effectiveness. This study also raises troubling concerns about current practices in nursing pedagogy, particularly the emphasis on standardized testing and highly structured didactics, and the overlap between student evaluation systems and the technologies of neoliberalism.\n",

        "abstract": "The global COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s social, economic, and health consequences are far-reaching, and the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impact, coupled with movements against systemic racism, have exposed deep structural challenges in our society. As citizens and policymakers respond to these challenges, American democracy and societies worldwide are at a crossroads. In How Democracies Die, Levitsky and Ziblatt (Citation2018) asserted that \u201cAmerican democracy depends on us \u2013 the citizens of the United States. No single political leader can end a democracy; no single leader can rescue one, either\u201d (p. 230). Can we meet this challenge of shared civic responsibilities in a highly polarized polity? Do our schools and other core institutions have the capacity and the will to inspire our children and young adults\u2019 civility and civic purpose? Can we revive civic trust as the majority of our citizens lose confidence in our governing institutions? Will the next generation of American citizens be ready to exercise their voting rights and free speech? Will inequalities in civic engagement widen in the context of growing economic inequality? Is deliberative democracy fading in the American polity? These issues are at the core of the design, practice, and future of democratic practices in the United States and beyond. The papers in this special issue raise the saliency and the relevance of these issues while suggesting steps that civic actors \u2013 whether teachers, researchers, students, parents, taxpayers, or other members of the public \u2013 can and do take to encourage greater democratic living. The worrisome state of American democracy calls for a systematic examination of civic education and civic capacity, the foundational pillars of democratic life. Mounk (Citation2018) found that only one-third of millennials (versus two-thirds of those born in the 1930s and 1940s) thought living in a democratic society was very important. Studies (e.g., CCSSO, Citation2018) show curricula are narrowing due to high stakes accountability, often excluding or marginalizing civics education. Schools can play an important role in increasing civic engagement generally and decreasing gaps in civic engagement that exist (Levinson, Citation2012), but civic opportunities are often inequitably distributed within schools (Kahne & Middaugh, Citation2008). In a political context shifting toward ideological polarization (Feldman et al., Citation2018) and populism (Roth, Citation2017) and away from transparent and public accountability around the globe, including in democracies, there is increasing interest in reaffirming democratic practices. In the US, part of the rationale for public schools has been to prepare people to be democratic citizens, both historically (Dewey, Citation1916) and currently (Gould et al., Citation2011). Given the longstanding commitment to civic education and the current urgency, this special issue offers a comprehensive, current understanding of the state of the field. Collectively, this special issue integrates theoretical and empirical work on civic education, civic capacity, and democratic practices. We view civic education as a set of learning goals shaped by the framework of liberal democracy (e.g., Dewey, Citation1916; Gutmann, Citation1987). Particular attention is given to the concepts and practice of action civics, a type of guided experiential civics education (Ballard et al., Citation2016; Cohen et al., Citation2018; Pope et al., Citation2011). Strengthening civic education will contribute to vibrant civic capacity, a concept commonly promoted by political scientists (e.g., Henig et al., Citation1999; Orr & Rogers, Citation2011; Putnam, Citation2000; Skocpol, Citation2003; Stone et al., Citation2001). Civic capacity departs from business-as-usual politics and fosters cross-sector collaboration to address a common challenge at the system-wide level. Examining the connection between civic education and civic capacity highlights inequalities in civic learning and the extent to which educational inadequacy may affect civic engagement, such as electoral turnouts and parental involvement in schooling issues (Orr et al., Citation2016). This special issue The multidisciplinary group of scholars and scholarly practitioners in this issue of the Peabody Journal of Education examine these topics as they relate to issues across a range of settings in the US and internationally. Our authors report on work being done at scale with diverse populations and address issues that are particularly relevant to education policy, politics, capacity building, and practice. Our first paper, by Fitzgerald et al. (Citation2021), offers a systematic review of the last decade of civics education research in the United States. Of the 648 studies reviewed, almost 70% focused on civic curricula, instructional practices, and learning outcomes. Civic skills and capacities and civic identities accounted for only 19% and 14% of the studies respectively. The authors found very few studies that incorporated marginalized voices in politics and addressed increasing political polarization. The paper identifies directions for future research that could support efforts to broaden youth civic participation and decrease political polarization. The next several papers in the issue focus on civic education and democratic practices in schools. In the United States, Littenberg-Tobias (Citation2021) explores relationships between active learning in civics and students\u2019 civic knowledge using NAEP civics data. He found that active learning experiences were positively associated with increases in student knowledge, but the overall effect sizes were fairly small. However, after applying a different method for measuring active learning that emphasized quality not quantity of experience and taking into account potential overuse of activities, the effect size was substantially larger. DiGiacomo et al. (Citation2021) studied teachers\u2019 civic education experiences and perspectives in a politically and demographically diverse school district. How teachers conceptualized civic education varied widely, from preparing students to be critical thinkers, to teaching how to be good \u201ccitizens,\u201d to showing them how to exercise their voice in civic activities. Sociopolitical contexts and other external challenges shaped how teachers integrated civics into their classes and classroom practices. Importantly, while teachers felt strongly about supporting students\u2019 civic development, they lacked systematic support for doing so routinely. Some papers explored nonprofits\u2019 work on civic education. McAvoy and McAvoy (Citation2021) studied the Close Up Washington program and reported on the differential polarization of high school students who experience political discussion in deliberative small groups versus debate activities and offer ideas for reducing polarization. The lessons about how discussion strategies impact student polarization are especially important for teachers who engage controversial or contentious issues in what can be already polarized classrooms. Andes et al. (Citation2021) reflect on over a decade of Generation Citizen\u2019s school-based programming, highlighting three important qualities for a successful nonpartisan program: local focus, diversity, and community and student voice. Their attention to being political in a nonpartisan way is particularly important for pedagogical approaches like action civics, which encourage student voice, agency, and action. This can inform the future of action civics education in schools, regardless of the political leanings of the school\u2019s area. Drawing on anti-racist theory and the knowledge base on community organizing, Kirshner et al. (Citation2021) propose a framework for scaling and sustaining justice-centered civic learning. Their theory of change is illuminated by an initiative sponsored by the Denver Public Schools that raised the awareness of students and teachers on injustices and broadened student engagement in action research and policy change. Among the facilitating features on critical civic engagement included teacher buy-in, organizational and content alignment, and student leadership development. Lessons learned from this case study have implications for moving action civics beyond merely a checklist. The issue also includes research from Cuba and Israel. Dawley-Carr (Citation2021) explores Cuba\u2019s K-12 citizenship education model and its current challenges. Historically, Cuban citizenship education, from its organizational structure to its civics curriculum, emphasized work in the planned economy as a central civic duty. With emerging privatization, today\u2019s Cuban youth face challenges to meeting this duty. The paper offers in-depth case studies of youth whose lived experiences showed varying educational and vocational pathways with shifting civic mindedness. Cohen and Eyal (Citation2021) study cross-sector alliances \u2013 partnerships between public schools and groups outside the formal education system \u2013 in Israeli high school civics courses. Interviews with teachers engaged in such partnerships yield valuable insights into how the civic ideology of outside groups intersects with and influences ideas of citizenship presented in classrooms. Cohen and Eyal warn of the potential for cross-sector alliances to reify particular, dominant conceptions of citizenship at the potential expense of marginalized groups. We conclude with papers focused on civic capacity and democratic practices in school districts. Morel (Citation2021) outlines how civic engagement and the politics of citizenship helped transform the public schools in Union City, New Jersey. He notes that the unique political constituency of Cuban Americans at a time that the state was led by Republicans (who were interested in Cuban Americans as potential Republican voters) offered the school district more flexibility in improving their school system than other districts, which led to sustained improvements. As polarization and politicization worsen across societies, it will be important to put politics aside (and not rely on state politicians deciding that there is political alignment) in order to support community engagement in school system transformation. Collins (Citation2021) brings nuanced findings to an important question: Who should be in charge of schools? Through a novel video-based survey experiment, Collins questions the otherwise straightforward finding that stakeholders generally prefer school boards over other forms of control such as school-site councils or state and federal bodies. He offers important clarifications about what kind of stakeholder prefers school boards. He also explores evidence and implications of stakeholder desires to engage with school boards directly. School stakeholders want opportunities for community members to engage in the deliberative democratic practice of school board decisions. This finding bodes well for broader efforts to promote democratic practice across the landscape of public schools. Throughlines Each article offers an important contribution to the field of civics education at a time when popular discourse around civics, citizenship, and democracy more generally seems despondent. Concerns of polarization, the lack of constructive discourse, and increasing isolation inside partisan \u201cecho chambers\u201d have been particularly visible in recent years and concern all of us who are committed to the tenets of democracy and the practice of democratic education. We invite readers to approach each article as an exploration of a particular piece of this larger challenge and hope that readers will engage with the ideas as they exist across and between the separate pieces. There is no single approach that will safeguard the future of civic education and democratic living. Instead, educators at every level must be prepared with the tools and dispositions to support a broad approach to this work. Three themes across this issue reveal both immediate classroom needs and future goals for educators and researchers: equity, polarization, and the role of curricula and pedagogy in promoting citizenship and civic action. These themes highlight the importance of schools as spaces for developing and practicing democracy in ways that can impact broader communities. Equity Many of these articles share an interest in issues of equity, and the different experiences marginalized students may have both as students and civic actors. Working toward equity will include ensuring that all students have equitable access to high-quality civics education in schools and that they also have equitable access to civic engagement opportunities and civic power beyond school as well. As the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated many inequities, including gaps in what educational opportunities youth experience, it will be important to closely monitor equity in civic education, civic capacity, and civic life. Polarization Schools can respond to the realities of polarization in national politics, and can also model consensus building, compromise and learning across differences, and be part of the solution toward reducing political polarization. Can schools provide a safe space where ideas on democracy and governance can be debated without repercussions? Will schools teach students how to earn respect and be respected when political discourse occurs? Addressing these issues in our schools will have broad ramifications for our next generation of leaders. The role of curricula Whether implicit or explicit, teachers offer certain ideas about citizenship as they craft curricula and/or as they transform provided curricula into enacted classroom activities. The pedagogies of citizenship can enable classrooms to serve as important sites for dialogues and deliberations about what democracy means and what democratic participation entails. While we agree that schools are the appropriate venue for such dialogues, we are also mindful of ongoing debates regarding not just types of citizenship, but the ways in which curricula open or close discussions of the relationships between teacher, student, and state. We hope, too, that future research will investigate those relationships as they move outside of the classroom, to interrogate the practices of deliberative democracy and voting beyond the school. Conclusion We are at a critical juncture: This decade will be formative for supporting democratic responses to overcoming the sizable challenges, including widening inequities, that have emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. Promoting collaborative (versus polarized), equitable civic participation to sustain societies is essential.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThe United States has witnessed a steady increase in concern about political polarization and its impact on youth. We systematically review and compare the empirical research literature on civic education pedagogy in the United States between 2009 and 2019 to frame efforts to construct an inclusive and healthy democracy\u2014one that decreases polarization and increases broad youth civic participation. Despite evidence that civic education must be revitalized to address societal inequities underlying participation and polarization, few articles addressed how to achieve such education. We recommend future researchers evaluate promising practices for increasing youth participation and decreasing political polarization. There is a related need for more civic education research in K\u201312 schools, particularly critical research focused on program implementation and outcomes.\n\nNotes\n1 We define marginalized youth as low-income youth and/or youth of color who experience socioeconomic or racialized forms of oppression (see Garcia Coll et al., Citation1996).\n\nGarc\u00eda Coll, C., Lamberty, G., Jenkins, R., McAdoo, H., Crnic, K., Wasik, B., & Garc\u00eda, H.

Today there is a wide body of empirical evidence that demonstrates partnering benefits outweigh the resources devoted to its implementation. Despite such outstanding outcomes, collaborative partnering is still new, misunderstood, underutilized, and evolving for airport construction projects that entail greater complexity and increased risks due to a high number of stakeholders and additional sector-specific regulations. The objectives of this study are to describe the state-of-practice regarding partnering in the aviation construction industry and offer insights about its use. A comprehensive survey of industry professionals representing DOTs, airports, and others involved in construction aviation projects in the United States helps capture partnering trends across the industry. Findings show that participants with experience in partnered-aviation construction projects perceive higher improvement of safety and reduced claims offering greater rewards. However, these projects are operating as late adopters of partnering with many at the initial stages of implementation. The main contribution of the paper to the body of knowledge is that partnering is suitable for airport projects regardless of the project delivery method followed, budget size, or partnering intensity levels. Those with greater experience with partnering under design-bid-build project delivery methods are more likely to perceive higher improvements. Furthermore, it increases trust and strengthens the relationships between organizations. The findings are significant as they bring attention to team integration practices for improved outcomes via the underutilized partnering in an industry niche where stakeholder and risk management are key to project success.\n",

        "abstract": "Previous research speculates that some regulations are counterproductive in the sense that they increase (rather than decrease) mortality risk. However, few empirical studies have measured the extent to which this phenomenon holds across the regulatory system as a whole. Using a novel U.S. state panel data set spanning the period 2000\u20132014, we estimate the effect of U.S. federal regulation on state\u2010level mortality. We find that a 1% increase in federal regulation of state economies is associated with an increase in an index of state mortality of between 0.53% and 1.35%. These findings are robust to the form of mortality measure, choice of covariates, and the inclusion/exclusion of various regions, states, and industries. We also provide an update of the \u201ccost\u2010per\u2010life saved cutoff,\u201d which is the counterproductive risk threshold for expenditures. We find that expenditures in excess of $38.6 million (2019 dollars) per life saved can be expected to increase mortality risk. This article fills an important gap in the empirical literature and boosts the credibility of mortality risk analysis, whereby public policymakers weigh both the expected lives saved and lost due to a proposed regulation or other policy.\n",

        "abstract": "Within the last decade, research has focussed on corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices as a strategic tool that enables firms to improve stakeholder perception, brand image and corporate reputation. However, one area that remains understudied is the role played by CSR practices in managing corporate reputation under conditions of supply chain risk. To answer this research question, we conduct a literature review and develop the corresponding hypothesis. We test our hypothesis using quantitative analysis of both primary and secondary data collected from organizations dispersed globally. The results highlight that under conditions of supply chain network disruption risk, CSR practices play an important role in enabling firms to manage the negative impact of such risk drivers on corporate reputation. The study further suggests that CSR practices positively impact supply chain risk management (SCRM) practices and are a necessary condition for SCRM practices to be effective in improving corporate reputation of organizations.\n",

        "abstract": "Communication systems often include a variety of components, including those that span modalities, which may facilitate detection and decision-making. For example, female t\u00fangara frogs and fringe-lipped bats generally rely on acoustic mating signals to find male t\u00fangara frogs in a mating or foraging context, respectively. However, two additional cues (vocal sac inflation and water ripples) can enhance detection and choice behavior. To date, we do not know the natural variation and covariation of these three components. To address this, we made detailed recordings of calling males, including call amplitude, vocal sac volume and water ripple height, in 54 frogs (2430 calls). We found that all three measures correlated, with the strongest association between the vocal sac volume and call amplitude. We also found that multimodal models predicted the mass of calling males better than unimodal models. These results demonstrate how multimodal components of a communication system relate to each other and provide an important foundation for future studies on how receivers integrate and compare complex displays.\n",

        "abstract": "Many studies have investigated the effect of aerobic exercise on factors associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Aerobic exercise is an essential component in the management and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The aim of this study was to determine and evaluate the effect of aerobic exercise on fasting blood glucose, Insulin, Insulin resistance, Glycosylated hemoglobin (Hemoglobin A1C), Lipid profile as important indicators of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Methods:This research is a systematic review and meta-analysis that was conducted in 2021. For the present study, databases, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus, science of Web, SID, Magiran and Google Scholar from 2010 to 2021, were searched along with keywords. After the initial screening, the full text of the articles was evaluated and the articles that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. A total of 120 articles were reviewed, of which 16 articles met the criteria for entering the systematic review and meta-analysis. Accordingly, 710 people with fatty liver disease were divided into two groups of control and experimental group of 307 and 403 people, respectively. The mean age of the subjects in the present study was 52\u00b110 years. The intervention effects were evaluated using the mean difference (MD) and the random effects model. Data were analyzed using effect size tests, bias analysis and heterogeneity analysis and by STATA software.Results:Meta-analysis results indicated that endurance training in general significantly reduced glucose levels (P = 0.004, SDM = -0.26, SE = 0.09), insulin (P = 0.01, SDM = -0.29, SE = 0.11), HOMA-IR (P = 0.01, SDM = -0.28, SE = 0.11), Hba1c (P = 0.001, SDM = -0.33, SE = 0.12), triglycerides (P = 0.02, SDM = -0.31, SE = 0.13) and LDL (P = 0.03, SDM = -0.21, SE = 0.1). The results of meta-analysis did not show a significant effect on HDL levels after aerobic exercise in patients with fatty liver (P = 0.97, SDM = 0, SE = 0.09).Conclusion:Endurance training improves the levels of glucose, insulin, Hba1c, Homa-IR, triglyceride, and LDL; although, there was no significant change in HDL levels due to endurance training. However, there is still a need for more and higher quality research in this area.\n",

        "abstract": "Ideally an athlete would continue to improve performance indefinitely over time, however improvement slows as the athlete approaches their genetic limits. Measuring performance is complex\u2014performance may be temporarily depressed following aggressive training for multiple reasons, physiological and psychosocial. This reality may be vexing to the strength and conditioning coach, who, as a service provider, must answer to sport coaches about an athlete\u2019s progress. Recently an evaluation mechanism for strength and conditioning coaches was proposed, in part to help coaches establish their effectiveness within the organization. Without formal guidance and realistic expectations, if an athlete is not bigger, leaner, stronger, etc. as a result of training within a specified timeframe, blame is often placed upon the strength and conditioning coach. The purpose of this article is to explore possible causes of what may be perceived as athlete non-responses to training and to provide guidance for the coach on how to handle those issues within their domain. A process of investigation is recommended, along with resources to assist coaches as they consider a broad range of issues, including enhancing existing testing methods, improving athlete behaviors, and adjusting processes designed to bring about performance improvement.\n",

        "abstract": "During the 21st century, human\u2013environment interactions will increasingly expose both systems to risks, but also yield opportunities for improvement as we gain insight into these complex, coupled systems. Human\u2013environment interactions operate over multiple spatial and temporal scales, requiring large data volumes of multi\u2010resolution information for analysis. Climate change, land\u2010use change, urbanization, and wildfires, for example, can affect regions differently depending on ecological and socioeconomic structures. The relative scarcity of data on both humans and natural systems at the relevant extent can be prohibitive when pursuing inquiries into these complex relationships. We explore the value of multitemporal, high\u2010density, and high\u2010resolution LiDAR, imaging spectroscopy, and digital camera data from the National Ecological Observatory Network\u2019s Airborne Observation Platform (NEON AOP) for Socio\u2010Environmental Systems (SES) research. In addition to providing an overview of NEON AOP datasets and outlining specific applications for addressing SES questions, we highlight current challenges and provide recommendations for the SES research community to improve and expand its use of this platform for SES research. The coordinated, nationwide AOP remote sensing data, collected annually over the next 30\u00a0yr, offer exciting opportunities for cross\u2010site analyses and comparison, upscaling metrics derived from LiDAR and hyperspectral datasets across larger spatial extents, and addressing questions across diverse scales. Integrating AOP data with other SES datasets will allow researchers to investigate complex systems and provide urgently needed policy recommendations for socio\u2010environmental challenges. We urge the SES research community to further explore questions and theories in social and economic disciplines that might leverage NEON AOP data.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTIn today\u2019s increasingly volatile world, organisations including healthcare providers need interfirm dynamic capabilities to make timely responses to supply chains changes. There has been a wealth of literature on dynamic capabilities; however, very few are at interfirm level and even fewer are conducted in the healthcare industry. Grounded in information processing view, this study contributes to the literature by examining interfirm dynamic capabilities in the context of healthcare delivery networks. It proposes the interfirm dynamic capabilities as a form of information processing capability with five dimensions: sensing, learning, coordination, collective mind and partner development. Using data collected from healthcare delivery networks, this study explores the impact of interfirm dynamic capabilities on hospitals\u2019 performance. The findings suggest that the fit between a healthcare delivery network's interfirm dynamic capabilities and information processing requirements will improve its operational capabilities, which will lead to better performance.KEYWORDS: Information processing view, interfirm dynamic capabilities, information processing requirement, information processing capacity; healthcare delivery network.

        "abstract": "Kindergarten through second\u2010grade elementary schools that best serve students with dyslexia have principals who are knowledgeable about dyslexia and understand the best practices for providing intervention for students with dyslexia. In this study, three styles of leadership were examined to understand the implication that leadership has on intervention for dyslexia: transformational, instructional, and integrated leadership. However, many students in elementary schools have difficulty learning to read despite good leadership by the principal, with 5\u201320% of students being diagnosed with dyslexia. While these students need phonetic, multisensory intervention to build necessary reading skills, this study found that many principals lack knowledge of this specialized instruction. The purpose of this research was to explore variables that determine the school\u2010based level of appropriate intervention for students with dyslexia. A questionnaire assessing leadership skills, knowledge, and beliefs about dyslexia, preparation in reading disorders and/or dyslexia received from degree programs and professional development, and services provided to students with dyslexia was given to K\u20102 principals serving in schools across the United States. Results indicated that regardless of leadership style, principals who have greater knowledge and more correct beliefs about dyslexia provide more appropriate school\u2010based services for students with dyslexia. Eight detailed K\u20102 principal/practitioner recommendations are included based upon this key finding.\n",

SIT is a time-efficient strategy to improve aerobic performance similar to moderate intensity continuous training (MICT). There has been a relative absence of studies on neuromuscular adaptations of SIT.\nPURPOSE: To compare the effects of stationary air biking, utilizing high-volume MICT and low-volume SIT (i.e., ultrashort-SIT [US], short-SIT [SS]) on neuromuscular system.\nMETHODS: Thirty recreationally active females were randomly assigned to MICT (n = 10), US (n = 10), and SS (n = 10) groups. The intervention consisted of 3 d/wk for 4 wks. MICT was performed by 30 min of cycling at 75% of maximal heart rate reserve, while SIT (i.e., US, SS) consisted of 3 sets of 8 intervals at maximal effort intensity. SS and US were performed with 20s:10s and 10s:5s work-to-rest ratios and provided with 5- and 2.5-min recovery periods between sets, respectively. Muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) and echo intensity (EI) of rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL) were measured by ultrasound system. Isometric strength testing protocol consisted of 3 maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC). During each contraction, surface electromyography (sEMG) and torque signals were recorded to assess sEMG amplitude (RMS) of RF and VL as well as peak torque (PT). All variables were measured before and after intervention and were analyzed with 2-way mixed factorial ANOVAs. Moreover, average total work (TW) during 12 sessions was recorded and analyzed with one-way ANOVA.\nRESULTS: There were significant (p < 0.05) differences in TW (MICT: 142.7 \u00b1 31.5 cal., US: 52.6 \u00b1 10.0 cal., SS: 92.3 \u00b1 7.8 cal.) between groups. All groups significantly (p < 0.05) improved mCSA of RF (MICT: 9.0 \u00b1 1.0 to 9.5 \u00b1 1.1 cm2, US: 9.9 \u00b1 3.5 to 10.6 \u00b1 3.6 cm2, SS: 9.0 \u00b1 1.9 to 9.7 \u00b1 1.5 cm2) and VL (MICT: 20.0 \u00b1 2.3 to 20.6 \u00b1 2.1 cm2, US: 20.8 \u00b1 5.1 to 22.5 \u00b1 5.2 cm2, SS: 19.6 \u00b1 2.6 to 21.4 \u00b1 3.8 cm2). No significant (p > 0.05) differences observed in EI values as well as RMS and PT during MVIC.\nCONCLUSION: Despite no significant improvements in neural activation and isometric strength, all groups similarly improved muscular morphology of RF and VL by performing SIT on a stationary air bike. These findings suggest that SIT can elicit muscular morphological adaptations with a shorter time commitment.\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 by the American College of Sports Medicine\n",

        "abstract": "Rodents are known to signal using odors to communicate information including their sex, age, reproductive state, and unique identity. Conspecifics can recognize these signals and behaviorally respond in sex\u2010specific ways. However, we know little about how males and females might differ in their responses to signals from individuals or how the sexes might differ in their ability to recognize their own identity. Such signals of identity are important because they can modulate the behavior of receivers, and allow for responses related to aggression, territory maintenance, affiliation, and reproduction. To assess how males and females might differ in their responses to individual familiar and novel social signals, and their own individual signals compared to novel same\u2010sex conspecifics, we tested southern giant pouched rats (Cricetomys ansorgei) using a habituation\u2013discrimination paradigm. Only females showed individual recognition and discriminated among males, preferring novel males. Females also discriminated between their own scent and a novel conspecific odor. Males did not discriminate or demonstrate individual recognition. Male and female differences in response to opposite\u2010sex odors demonstrated that males do not discriminate between familiar and novel reproductively available females, but females discriminate and prefer to investigate novel males.\n",

        "abstract": "Borders play a profound role in human life. In many settings, land borders are highly permeable and provide little barrier to movement, communication and interaction. In other circumstances, borders are highly rigid, difficult to cross and can demarcate vast economic and social disparities. The widely differing circumstances related to border creation and maintenance have deep effects that are worthy of social work attention and engagement. There has been serious attention to issues of globalisation, immigration and human rights in the social work literature. Our focus on borders is related to, but distinct from these issues, and therefore, has something unique to offer. Increased globalisation has led to a major reconceptualisation in our understanding of borders. The COVID-19 epidemic demonstrates the limited relevance of borders in some circumstances (spreading of the virus) but the heightened relevance of borders in other circumstances (travel restrictions). Social work practitioners have a role in framing the understanding of borders and resulting policies. Our focus is to address the question: How has social work engaged with border issues? We examine three international cases and conduct a comparative analysis to examine similarities and differences. From the analysis, we draw conclusions to further understanding for social work.\n",

        "abstract": "For the past several decades, machine learning has played an important role in sports science with regard to player performance and result prediction. However, it is still challenging to quantify team-level game performance because there is no strong ground truth. Thus, a team cannot receive feedback in a standardized way. The aim of this study was twofold. First, we designed a metric called LAX-Score to quantify a collegiate lacrosse team's athletic performance. Next, we explored the relationship between our proposed metric and practice sensing features for performance enhancement. To derive the metric, we utilized feature selection and weighted regression. Then, the proposed metric was statistically validated on over 700 games from the last three seasons of NCAA Division I women's lacrosse. We also explored our biometric sensing dataset obtained from a collegiate team's athletes over the course of a season. We then identified the practice features that are most correlated with high-performance games. Our results indicate that LAX-Score provides insight into athletic performance beyond wins and losses. Moreover, though COVID-19 has stalled implementation, the collegiate team studied applied our feature outcomes to their practices, and the initial results look promising with regard to better performance.\n",

        "abstract": "Cattle treated with chemicals to control parasites can fecally excrete residues that have the potential to adversely affect local assemblages of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). Using 200-m transects and dung-baited pitfall traps, we compared the dung beetle communities on 19 cattle farms in Maryland, USA where pests and/or parasites were controlled with chemicals (CU, n = 9 farms) or where no chemicals were used (NCU, n = 10 farms). Traps were baited once a month with fresh cattle dung from each location. We collected a total of 31 species comprising 12,380 dung beetle specimens. The five most abundant species, Onthophagus taurus (Schreber), Onthophagus pennsylvanicus Harold, Onthophagus hecate (Panzer), Blackburneus stercorosus (Melsheimer), and Labarrus pseudolividus (Balthasar), accounted for 85% of the total individuals sampled. No difference was found when comparing total abundances of dung beetles sampled from NCU and CU farms. There was, however, a consistent significant effect of month across multiple dominant species. Using Random Forests analyses, we determined site location, soil type, and chemical lethality as additional important predictor variables affecting dung beetle abundances on Maryland farms. Present-day management practices implement a broad spectrum of chemical usage. Our work examines this variability to facilitate the understanding of factors currently affecting the biodiversity and abundance of beneficial dung beetles. The Coleopterists Bulletin publishes a wide variety of articles, notes, and book reviews regarding the biology, taxonomy and ecology of beetles (Coleoptera).\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThe goal of this paper is to investigate how deregulating foreign equity ownership influences a firm\u2019s innovation investment. We attempt to answer this question using data from 530 Korean manufacturing firms between 1998 and 2003 through generalised estimating equations. Our findings suggest that foreign ownership and R&D investment exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship because the incentives to monitor managers\u2019 decision-making processes initially play a greater role, but this role stagnates as the share owned by foreign investors becomes concentrated. In addition, we consider firm heterogeneity and observe the negative moderation effects of firm age and the positive moderation effects of growth opportunity.\n\nKEYWORDS: Corporate governance reforms, institutional changes, foreign investors, R&D intensity\n\nDisclosure statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nFunding: This work was supported by Hankuk University of Foreign Studies research fund.\n\nNotes on contributors:\nKwangWook Gang received the Ph.D. degree in strategic management from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Empathy with a rape victim was examined based on knowing a rape victim (not oneself), personal sexual victimization experience, and participant gender. Undergraduates (n = 531) at a midsize public university in the Northeast United States completed the Rape-Victim Empathy Scale, the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization, and questions regarding knowing a rape victim. Empathy scores were greater for those who reported knowing a rape victim than for those who did not. Women with personal sexual victimization experience reported greater empathy than men with personal sexual victimization experience and all nonvictims, but no differences emerged among female nonvictims and all men. Findings suggest that knowing a rape victim may provide some degree of vicarious experience with rape that helps individuals better understand a rape victim\u2019s perspective, and factors influencing rape empathy among men and nonvictims needs more attention in future research.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTAs lesson study becomes more prevalent, there is a need to continuously develop theoretical and methodological infrastructure to support and refine its use. In this article, we present a critical methodological analysis of the challenges and benefits of using Toulmin\u2019s argumentation model in mathematics education to assess the debriefing phase of lesson study. During debriefing sessions, teachers offer arguments about how to improve teaching that are grounded in observations of students\u2019 learning. Toulmin\u2019s model provides a means to analyze the structure of such arguments. Using an empirical example, we illustrate challenges of using the model, such as determining appropriate grain sizes for data and claims, evaluating qualifiers, recognizing multiple categories of backing, identifying implicit warrants, and deciding between the individual or the group as a unit of analysis. We also discuss benefits such as being able to systematically compare mathematics teachers\u2019 pedagogical arguments against one another, assess attainment of debriefing session goals, and characterize group discursive dynamics. Despite the challenges of using the Toulmin model, we conclude that it provides a useful framework for systematic analysis of lesson study debriefing sessions. The present article can help researchers anticipate and address challenges of conducting Toulmin-based qualitative analyses of debriefing session discourse.KEYWORDS: Lesson studyargumentationdiscoursequalitative researchprofessional developmentAcknowledgmentsThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under award DUE- 1852139.

        "abstract": "Surface treatment is commonly used in controlling the red imported fire ants,Solenopsis invictaBuren. In the present study, the behavioral responses ofS. invictaworkers to surfaces treated with insecticides were investigated. Toxicological tests showed that beta-cypermethrin had the highest contact toxicity (with the lowest LC50value) among nine tested insecticides, followed by thiamethoxam, fipronil, indoxacarb, chlorfenapyr, rotenone, spinetoram, avermectin, and chlorantraniliprole. In the laboratory, surfaces treated beta-cypermethrin or rotenone significantly reduced the number of foraging ants. In addition,S. invictaworkers transported significantly more particles (measured in weight and/or covered area) onto surfaces treated with fipronil (50, 500, and 5000 ppm), rotenone (5000 ppm), or avermectin (5000 ppm) compared with the controls. Similarly, these insecticides significantly triggered the particle-covering behavior of ants in the field. We hypothesized that such behaviors would reduce the contact toxicity of insecticides againstS. invicta.When the surfaces treated with fipronil or rotenone (500 or 5000 ppm) were artificiality covered with particles,S. invictahad significantly higher LT50values compared with insecticide-treated surfaces without particles.This study provides the first evidence thatS. invictaworkers can perform particle-covering behavior to reduce the toxicity of certain insecticides, which constitutes a unique insecticide-resistance strategy in ants.\n",

        "abstract": "Salt marsh evolution is strongly affected by tidal processes and ecology, which regulate sediment accretion and erosional rates. A balance between marsh erosion and deposition in a restored tidal wetland is crucial for analyzing restoration strategies to adopt in a natural context. Here, we present an integrated approach monitoring salt marsh seasonal changes over several months in a microtidal restored salt marsh of the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island (MD, USA). The project is undertaken at a restoration site where sediment dredged from the shipping channels in the upper Chesapeake Bay is being used to restore a tidal marsh habitat in mid-Chesapeake Bay. We flew an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with an RGB and a multispectral camera to obtain a high-resolution map of the planimetric position of vegetation and to monitor the health of the marsh vegetation in diverse seasons. Due to its extension of 400 m by 400 m, a total of four flight plans were necessary to cover the entire marsh flying at a 40 m altitude obtaining a 2 cm Ground Sample Distance (GSD). This technique provides reliable results at a very low cost, enabling an accurate assessment of the marsh platforms to be conducted over time, due to both the very high spatial resolution and the precise georeferencing of the images for the comparisons. Our results show seasonal variability in the two dominant species colonizing the low marsh, Spartina alterniflora, and high marsh, Sporobolus pumilus. While the lower marshes showed a higher variability along seasons, the up-land vegetation showed persistent green foliage during cold seasons. Detecting salt marsh evolution and seasonality coupled with field measurements can help to improve the accuracy of hydrodynamic and sediment transport models. Understanding the drivers of salt marsh evolution is vital for informing restoration practices and designs, in order to improve coastal resilience, and develop and coastal management strategies.\n",

We paired 5 transects of 100 m in forest habitats with 5 transects in dune and grassland habitats, with pitfall traps set every 10 m along each transect. During a 5-month period (May\u2013September), we collected 26 species of ants, including 9 that had not been previously recorded on the island and 2 that had never been recorded east of Maryland's Chesapeake Bay. Forest habitats had a significantly higher species richness than the dunes, with 24 and 14 species collected, respectively. Our research provides baseline data on ant species richness for this temperate barrier island using pitfall-collection methods. We provide evidence for forest habitats supporting higher species richness and make suggestions for future research.\n",

Some methods, such as the use of beehives, chili fences and electric fences, seem to reduce, but not eliminate, human/elephant conflict and property loss (Karidozo et al., 2006). However, these methods require permanent infrastructure and are difficult to deploy quickly. As with most human/wildlife conflict, it is individual elephants, not the species as a whole, that are responsible for this conflict (ibid.). Elephants have large home ranges, and these individuals can shift the locus of their activity from one site to another. When conflict occurs, the most common solution is to kill the elephant (Karidozo & Osborn, 2015), even though both species of African (Loxodonta africana) and Asian (Elephas maximus) elephants are currently endangered. Here we present a case study of an alternate method to killing, disruptive darting, that can be deployed quickly on elephants visiting a location where they are not desired, with obvious ethical and conservation benefits.\nThe subject of this study is a male elephant ~35 years old, who carries a GPS collar as part of a larger study. His home range includes the town of Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, a popular tourist destination. Located within Victoria Falls National Park, the town\u2019s tourism areas and residential properties connect directly to the surrounding wildlife areas. Therefore, it is common to observe wildlife traveling close to humans and their properties \u2013 sometimes even walking downtown during the daylight.\nIn July 2018, our subject began to feed on trees near the Victoria Falls Baobab Elementary School, which caused concerns when children were playing in the school yard. The school contacted the Zimbabwe Parks & Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks), requesting he be \u2018removed\u2019 from their property. In an effort to keep the bull alive, and the children safe, ZimParks allowed us to anesthetize the animal and apply concentrated chili wax (>150,000 Scoville units) on sensitive parts of his body (avoiding the eyes). Based on human reactions to the wax, this would have caused non-lethal, temporary but intense discomfort, lasting 45\u201390 min (Osborn and Karidozo, pers. comm.).\nThe bull approached within 375 m of the school buildings on three consecutive days immediately before the application of the wax, spending most of each day there. After application he immediately left and stayed away from the area around the school for 1 year and 2 months, never entering the school yard nor approaching closer than 375 m. After this period of complete avoidance, he came within 375 m of the school only three times, in September and October 2020. These visits were always during the night when no humans were present. This nocturnal behavior is consistent with other studies about elephants avoiding humans (Shaffer et al., 2019). In the 2 years after the mitigation, he has yet to approach within 250 m of the school.\nHowever, while he largely avoided the location of the mitigation event for over 2 years, and still seems to be avoiding humans in that area by visiting only at night, he did not generalize this avoidance to all humans, since he still visited other parts of the town, when people were present, during this period.\nThe movements of the bull 8 months before the application of the wax to 29 months afterward (Langbauer et al., 2021) are summarized on a story map located at: (https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/b5fecacad6b544afb4afae42a0532089).\nThus, this disruptive darting, while having notable implementation costs in terms of personnel and materials, produced a long-term effect that benefits the conservation of elephants and reduces human\u2013elephant conflict. This may make the costs comparable to installing and maintaining infrastructure solutions like bee hives or fencing over a comparable period. Disruptive darting can be deployed quickly, and it keeps alive endangered elephants that would otherwise be killed. There is also the potential, yet to be explored, that an elephant initially treated with disruptive darting may associate the smell of capsicum with the experience, and thus be deterred by less invasive and less expensive mitigation methods, such as burning chili-infused dung bricks.\nIn addition to its practical benefits, the method described here has implications for the study of the cognitive behavior of elephants. Elephants are known to have excellent spatial memory (Polansky et al., 2015) and the ability to discriminate between humans whom they perceive as a threat and those whom they perceive as safe (McComb et al., 2014). Our study is consistent with these findings, in that the elephant seemed to associate the unpleasant event with a specific location, and perhaps with people at that location, rather than people in general. Further investigation of this technique may provide insight into the cognitive processes of an intelligent non-human animal.\n\nAcknowledgment\nWe thank the Zimbabwe Parks & Wildlife Management Authority for making this study possible.\n\nReferences\n\nKaridozo, M., La Grange, M. & Osborn, F.V.

        "abstract": "Prior research links adaptive humor styles (affiliative and self-enhancing) with enhanced psychological well-being and maladaptive humor styles (aggressive and self-defeating) with worse psychological well-being, primarily through humor styles\u2019 influence on individuals\u2019 social interactions and efforts to positively reframe stressors. The present study examined the unique relation of each humor style with psychological well-being with a focus on understanding mechanisms of adjustment under highly stressful conditions. Ninety-nine parents of children with disabilities were surveyed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in March 2020, and 79 parents completed follow-up surveys in July 2020. As predicted, at T1, self-enhancing humor was associated with less psychological distress and greater family satisfaction, self-defeating humor was associated with greater distress, and aggressive humor was associated with lower family satisfaction. Moreover, affiliative humor predicted decreased psychological distress over time, whereas self-defeating humor predicted increased psychological distress and decreased family satisfaction over time. Relations were largely mediated by caregiver positive reappraisal, family efforts to reframe daily disability-related challenges, and negative social interactions. Future research should further examine the influence of caregiver humor styles on family dynamics, family reframing norms, and caregiving efficacy.\n",

        "abstract": "## Context:\nThere is a clear need for quality improvement in health care. The 2020 Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education Standards for Professional Athletic Training Programs require students to apply concepts of quality improvement to provide athletic training care and deliver excellent patient outcomes. As such, programs may be looking for strategies to view students' clinical experiences through a lens of quality improvement.\n\n## Objective:\nTo introduce the Critical Assessment and Reflection on Experience (CARE) form, which is a novel clinical education tool that assesses student clinical skills using critical reflection and quality improvement concepts.\n\n## Background:\nHistorically, students have demonstrated achievement by comparing their skill performance with a competency checklist. Typically, the skills assessed, and the level of achievement expected progress to allow learning over time. However, current athletic training clinical education literature has shifted to promote experiential learning, critical thinking, and active reflection to develop competence.\n\n## Description:\nStudents complete the CARE form after patient encounters or other clinical experiences. The form requires students to practice documentation and communication skills, but also to critically reflect on performance by applying quality improvement, patient safety, and evidence-based practice concepts.\n\n## Clinical Advantage(s):\nThe form holds advantages for multiple stakeholders, including students, preceptors, and program administrators. The CARE form encourages students to engage in authentic patient interactions rather than relying on contrived learning experiences. By encouraging live patient encounters, this tool results in less burden on preceptors to create additional opportunities for students. Program administrators can use the tool to incorporate quality improvement standards meaningfully into the curriculum. Additionally, the CARE form creates opportunity to document program assessment.\n\n## Conclusion(s):\nProfessional programs should consider implementing the CARE form as a clinical experience assessment tool to develop students' quality improvement and critical thinking skills when providing athletic training services.\n",

An extensive literature on affect balance suggests that it is not only positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) alone that affect well\u2010being; rather it is the balance between them that matters. We use experience sampling methods and polynomial regression to test the notion that daily PA and NA at work, along with their interactive and nonlinear effects, predict employee well\u2010being after work. In a sample of working adults, we find that affect balance\u2014the dynamic interplay between daily PA and NA\u2014at work was differentially associated with various indices of well\u2010being: PA, NA, and the interaction between them predicted physical and mental health. Affect balance at work also predicted life satisfaction, but only for those low on trait affect balance. Detailed examination of the joint effects of PA, NA, and the balance between them reveals that high PA at work is most important for life satisfaction, whereas both low NA and high PA are important for health. Low NA plays an especially important role in physical health.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nMuslim women experience gendered Islamophobia because their Muslim identity is often more visible and comes to symbolize their culture. Experiencing discrimination can cause stress and negative mental health outcomes. However, Muslim identity can also be a source of coping, and the Muslim community can be a source of support in the face of Islamophobia. We hypothesized that openness about identity within the Muslim community may differ based on gender and that experiences of discrimination would be associated with a desire to hide one\u2019s Muslim identity in public for women but not for men. Seventy-three Muslim college students were recruited through snowball sampling in a cross-sectional survey in North America. Mean differences and correlational patterns were compared between women (n = 35) and men (n = 30). Correlational and regression analyses revealed that for women but not men, discrimination was correlated with hiding one\u2019s Muslim identity in public. Microaggressions and offence at Trump\u2019s proposed travel ban were related to openness with other Muslims for women only. Women were more offended than men by Trump\u2019s statement but only after President Trump took office. Intersectionality needs to be unpacked to better understand the multidimensional nature of gendered Islamophobia and racist policy actions.\n\nKEYWORDS: Gendered Islamophobia, Muslim women, religious identity, intersectionality, travel ban\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nNotes\n1.

The current study examined self-esteem based on the two verbal coercion items included in the latest version of the most popular measure of sexual victimization experience, the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization (SES-SFV; Koss et al., 2007 ). One item includes verbal tactics categorized as \u201cthreat\u201d and the other item includes verbal tactics categorized as \u201ccriticism.\u201d Undergraduate women ( n = 479) completed the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the SES-SFV. Results showed that women who experienced criticism reported lower self-esteem than those who did not experience criticism. However, threat experience was not significantly related to women\u2019s self-esteem. Findings support Koss et al.\u2019s suggestion that criticism tactics are more negative than threat tactics, and imply that self-esteem may be negatively associated with some sexually coercive verbal tactics but not associated with others. Future researchers should pay careful attention to operational definitions of verbal coercion.\n",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of mobile money (MM) on SMEs' resilience and the associated business outcome in developing countries amid Covid\u201019. Despite the potential of MM to improve SMEs' resilience, little evidence has been documented. Using Enterprise Survey data in Zambia, we show that SMEs are more likely than large firms to experience catastrophic sales decline, reflecting their inherent vulnerability. Further analysis reveals that this unfavourable effect can be effectively counteracted when SMEs incorporate MM into daily business. An important policy implication is that the use of digital technologies should be a key element of policy responses to Covid\u201019.\n",

This turned out to be a blessing in disguise as we were forced to come up with creative ways to get around this obstacle. The outcome is an outline of a pedagogically sound and even more robust instructional plan for an astronomy course using RSpec in conjunction with freely available databases. In addition to the traditional topics, the new model will allow an instructor to explore emission lines of variable Be stars like Gamma Cas and the classification of supernovae by an interpretation of their spectra. We argue that this new model should be used even if we return to the old normal.\n",

        "abstract": "Over 6 million Americans and 50 million persons worldwide are estimated to have Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) as it remains the major cause of dementia in the older adult population. Both healthcare professionals and family caregivers struggle with the complexities of caring for individuals with this progressive neurological disease. To address the ongoing knowledge and care gap regarding Alzheimer\u2019s disease among both healthcare professionals and family caregivers, a comprehensive massive open online course (MOOC) was developed and made available via the edX platform. MOOCs are open access and interactive courses offered via the web; they have emerged as a popular, self-paced mode of distance learning. Launched in 2020, the MOOC titled, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease & Dementia Care, consists of five modules reviewing symptoms, diagnosis, medications, communication and care tips, as well as a module outlining special considerations when the person with AD is hospitalized. While this educational strategy targets healthcare professionals (such as nurses, physical therapists and related practitioners), it is also designed for lay caregivers or anyone who wants to learn more the disease. The course utilizes a variety of teaching modalities and is free. To date over 7000 persons have enrolled from over 140 countries. MOOCs remain an innovative and engaging educational strategy to reach a global audience. More importantly, they can serve as an another outlet to enhance both the competence and confidence of both healthcare professionals and family caregivers by sharing best practices in caring for those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias.\n",

The author used content analysis to examine 74 accounts of practitioner\u2019s systematic and intentional inquiry in literacy contexts. Findings offer evidence that can enhance the credibility of empirical practitioner research. For example, practitioner researchers often being their inquiry with a research question or goal, are more likely than not to identify a research design, tend to collect multiple sources of data, and analyze the data in appropriate ways. Less common was attention to trustworthiness considerations. The paper concludes with recommendations for strengthening the methodological credibility for this type of inquiry and for viewing practitioners as creators of knowledge.\n",

The purpose was to 1) evaluate PA levels utilizing FITT-VP principles and 2) compare the patterns of PA in NA men and women.\n\n## Methods:\nRecruitment and evaluation (n= 586) took place as part of the OPREVENT2 study baseline evaluation. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire\u2013Short Form assessed frequency (days per week), intensity (walking, moderate, vigorous), and time (minutes per day). The total MET-minutes for the previous 7 d provided the volume of activity.\n\n## Results:\nThe NA sample was 45.8 \u00b1 15.1 yr of age, with a body mass index of 31.5 \u00b1 6.4 kg\u00b7m\u22122. The FIT-V corresponded to 4.7 \u00b1 2.3 d\u00b7wk\u22121, walking (3.3 METs intensity), 52 \u00b1 47 min\u00b7d\u22121, and 2536 \u00b1 2203 MET\u00b7min\u22121. The men (n= 162) reported a greater frequency of 3.2 \u00b1 2.5 d\u00b7wk\u22121(P= 0.007) of vigorous activity lasting 55 \u00b1 50 min\u00b7d\u22121compared with the women (n= 433) with 2.6 \u00b1 2.5 d\u00b7wk\u22121of vigorous activity lasting 34 \u00b1 38 min\u00b7d\u22121. The men reported higher MET-minutes than did the women (P= 0.0001). Overall, 71% of men and 77% of women met the recommended PA guidelines.\n\n## Conclusions:\nGiven that the majority of NA report adequate walking time and frequency, interventions are needed to improve moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic fitness, as well as muscular strength and endurance, neuromotor, and flexibility activities.\n",

        "abstract": "## Abstract\nChina experienced an unprecedented increase in labor strikes until the mid-2010s, and the country continues to experience considerable strike activity. Therefore, it is important to study what predicts Chinese workers\u2019 attitudes toward strikes. The study applies social exchange theory as an overarching framework to investigate the contributions of three forms of social exchange relations in organizations\u2014employee-employer relations, labor-management relations, and leader-member relations\u2014to account for Chinese employees\u2019 attitudes toward strikes in multinational corporations (MNCs) based in China. Using a matched employee-employer sample of more than 1,600 employees in 41 China-based MNCs, the results obtained from hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis show that individual-perceived employee-employer relations indicated by a negative reciprocity norm is positively related to employees\u2019 strike attitudes. Labor-management relations indicated by the organizational-level cooperative industrial relations (IR) climate is negatively related to employees\u2019 strike attitudes. Leader-member relations indicated by leader-member exchange (LMX) is not significantly related to employees\u2019 strike attitudes. Overall, the results indicate that at the individual level, it is more important for companies not to do bad (to engage in negative reciprocity with workers) than to do good to reduce employees\u2019 strike attitudes.\n\n### Keywords:\nStrike attitudes, reciprocity norm, industrial relations climate, leader-member exchange (LMX)\n\n### Disclosure statement:\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\n\n### Data availability statement:\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\n### Notes:\nWe thank one of the reviewers for this idea.\n\n### Additional information:\n#### Funding:\nThe authors acknowledge the support from the key program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71832004) and the Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Project (Grant No. 20YJA630061).\n",

        "abstract": "The use of smartphones in experimental physics is by now widely accepted and documented. PASCO scientific\u2019s smart cart, in combination with student-owned smartphones and free apps, has opened up a new universe of low-cost experiments that have traditionally required cumbersome and expensive equipment. In this paper we demonstrate the simplicity, convenience, and cost-saving achieved by replacing a plethora of traditional laboratory sensors, wires, air tracks, interface boards, and other equipment clutter with the smart cart and the free SPARKvue app for the smart cart by carrying out flyby measurements of the magnetic field of a Helmholtz coil. Recently, Monteiro et al. reported a similar experiment with a single coil but with an ordinary laboratory cart, and had to use the accelerometer of a smart-phone to laboriously extract the precise position of the mag-netic field sensor of the smartphone. The use of the smart cart in this report obviates the need for using the accelerometer and the concomitant laborious extraction of the position data. The eponymous smart cart broadcasts its precise location wirelessly over Bluetooth\u00ae. In addition to the single circular coil verification of the Biot-Savart law, we also used the Helmholtz coil to generate and measure a uniform magnetic field over a wide central region.\n",

        "abstract": "# Characterization of an l-Ascorbate Catabolic Pathway with Unprecedented Enzymatic Transformations\n\nl-Ascorbate (vitamin C) is ubiquitous in both our diet and the environment. Here we report that *Ralstonia eutropha* H16 (Cupriavidus necator ATCC 17699) uses l-ascorbate as sole carbon source via a novel catabolic pathway. RNaseq identified eight candidate catabolic genes, sequence similarity networks, and genome neighborhood networks guided predictions for function of the encoded proteins, and the predictions were confirmed by in vitro assays and in vivo growth phenotypes of gene deletion mutants. l-Ascorbate, a lactone, is oxidized and ring-opened by enzymes in the cytochrome b561 and gluconolactonase families, respectively, to form 2,3-diketo-l-gulonate. A protein predicted to have a WD40-like fold catalyzes an unprecedented benzilic acid rearrangement involving migration of a carboxylate group to form 2-carboxy-l-lyxonolactone; the lactone is hydrolyzed by a member of the amidohydrolase superfamily to yield 2-carboxy-l-lyxonate. A member of the PdxA family of oxidative decarboxylases catalyzes a novel decarboxylation that uses NAD+ catalytically. The product, l-lyxonate, is catabolized to \u03b1-ketoglutarate by a previously characterized pathway. The pathway is found in hundreds of bacteria, including the pathogens *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Acinetobacter baumannii*.\n",

        "abstract": "Noise is a common problem in animal communication. We know little, however, about how animals communicate in noise using multimodal signals. Multimodal signals are hypothesized to be favoured by evolution because they increase the efficacy of detection/discrimination in noisy environments. We tested the hypothesis that female t\u00fangara frogs\u2019 responses to attractive male advertisement calls are improved in noise when a visual signal component is added to the available choices. We tested this at two levels of decision complexity (two and three choices). In a two-choice test, the presence of noise did not reduce female preferences for attractive calls. The visual component of a calling male, associated with an unattractive call, also did not reduce preference for attractive calls in the absence of noise. In the presence of noise, however, females were more likely to choose an unattractive call coupled with the visual component. In three-choice tests, the presence of noise alone reduced female responses to attractive calls and this was not strongly affected by the presence or absence of visual components. The responses in these experiments fail to support the multimodal signal efficacy hypothesis. Instead, the data suggest that audio-visual perception and cognitive processing, related to mate choice decisions, are dependent on the complexity of the sensory scene.\n",

        "abstract": "Knowledge of population dynamics is critical for species of conservation concern so wildlife researchers need to take advantage of biases in animals' behaviors that could help them monitor populations. This is particularly important for amphibians because many populations are declining and difficult to observe. Attraction of vertebrates to light is a well\u2010known navigational cue and some fisheries strategies utilize light sources to increase catch success. To optimize population monitoring of state\u2010endangered eastern tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum), we tested the utility of colored glow sticks (green, orange, pink, or yellow) as bait in traps in Maryland and Delaware, USA, during 2015\u20132016. We then measured intensities of the colored glow sticks and estimated photoreceptive quantum catches of each color according to the spectral sensitivities of eastern tiger salamanders. We found that eastern tiger salamanders' photoreceptors had greater quantum catches of photons from green and yellow glow sticks. However, traps baited with orange glow sticks were more than twice as likely to capture eastern tiger salamanders than were traps baited with green or yellow. There were no differences in the number of salamanders caught per successful trap among glow stick colors, perhaps due to attraction of salamanders to motion from previously captured salamanders. Our results indicate that biases other than perceived intensity of light sources may drive behavioral preferences. \u00a9 2020 The Wildlife Society.\n",

He challenges many older interpretations by American historians concerning France's motives during the conflict. He focusses on how Napoleon III, his diplomats, people and press viewed the possibility of French intervention. A key factor in the study concerns France's occupation of Mexico as part of the emperor's \"Grand Design\" to win national glory, regain international influence, protect monarchical and imperial regimes, and save the Catholic Latin Race from worldwide Anglo-Saxon domination. The author maintains that Napoleon III's occupation of Mexico would have been impossible without the South's secession and that initially the emperor believed an independent Confederacy would be the last barrier that could block Yankee domination of Latin America.\n",

        "abstract": "This meta\u2010analysis found that the emotional intelligence\u2013organizational citizenship behavior relationship is stronger in long\u2010term oriented and restraint cultures. However, this relationship does not differ between individualistic and collectivistic cultures, masculine and feminine cultures, high uncertainty avoidance and low uncertainty avoidance cultures, and high power distance and low power distance cultures. The emotional intelligence\u2013counterproductive work behavior relationship is stronger in collectivistic, feminine, high uncertainty avoidance, high power distance, long\u2010term oriented, and restraint cultures. Emotional intelligence\u2013organizational citizenship behavior/counterproductive work behavior relationships are mediated by both state positive affect and state negative affect. Human resource development professionals from cultures where the effects of emotional intelligence are stronger are especially recommended to hire emotionally intelligent employees and/or provide emotional intelligence training to stimulate organizational citizenship behavior and to restrain counterproductive work behavior. Although there are important cross\u2010cultural differences, emotional intelligence universally encourages organizational citizenship behavior and almost universally diminishes counterproductive work behavior across cultures.\n",

One area of interest relates to the joint influence of tax avoidance and Corporate Social Responsibility on economic outcomes. We evaluate investor perceptions when these corporate behaviors are in conflict, and our results indicate that tax avoidance negatively influences investment decisions. We find that although CSR in isolation has no direct effect, the negative influence of tax avoidance is tempered when it is present. We provide evidence that not only do a firm's policies related to CSR and tax avoidance result in diverse investment intentions, but also that it is the individual's unique beliefs on ethics and CSR that appear to be driving these differences. Our results suggest that espousing stakeholder values serves as a shield to protect the company from the negative consequences associated with tax avoidance, and that individual attitudes can shape perceptions relative to these behaviors.\n",

        "abstract": "## Abstract\nFor many years, lesson study has been woven into the professional lives of Japanese teachers. Recently, it has become more widespread in the U.S. Core elements of Japanese Lesson Study include collaborative lesson design, empirical trials of lessons, collective analysis of empirical trials, and subsequent lesson re-design. We describe how these core elements were implemented in a teacher education project that brought together prospective and practicing secondary-level science and mathematics teachers in interdisciplinary groups facilitated by university faculty members. The four groups described in this report designed and analyzed lessons about attending to scale factor in the context of microscopic images, constructing a geologic timeline, examining states of matter, and building a scale model of the solar system. The Japanese Lesson Study process helped these groups reflect on the nature of the content being taught, pedagogical concerns, and content-specific pedagogy. We found that discursive moves such as connecting separate strands of conversation and identifying mistakes helped facilitate group reflection. A growing body of research suggests that Japanese Lesson Study can be implemented in a wide array of contexts; we encourage others to include it among clinical experiences for prospective teachers because of its potential to give more undergraduates access to the most skilled mentor teachers and to counteract feelings of professional isolation that cause many to leave teaching. We offer our own experiences facilitating lesson study and dealing with challenges along the way to help others start to implement the model in their own professional settings.\n\n**Keywords:** Japanese lesson study, collaboration, reflection, pre-service teachers, professional development\n\n**Additional information**\nFunding: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number DUE-1852139.

        "abstract": "Changes in forest size and composition can affect Neotropical migratory songbirds breeding in Eastern North America, leading to population fluctuations and declines. In 2012\u20132014, we conducted point counts at locations previously surveyed in 1981\u20131983 and analysed Breeding Bird Atlas data from 1980\u20132013 to estimate long-term population trends of two declining ground-nesting warblers on the Eastern Shore of Maryland within the Atlantic Coastal Plain: the Ovenbird Seiurus aurocapilla and the Worm-eating Warbler Helmitheros vermivorum. We detected significant declines for Ovenbirds in both datasets, but we found conflicting data for Worm-eating Warblers. During 2012\u20132015, we investigated the effects of forest characteristics, such as vegetative composition and ground cover, on occupancy and nest success. Ovenbirds were found more where there were more and larger trees but were negatively affected by the proportion of pines, whereas Worm-eating Warblers were more abundant when there were higher numbers of trees and more pines. Nest success was not affected by vegetation other than the proportion of pine trees or leaf litter depth, both of which increased nest success. Worm-eating Warblers with more pine needles in their nests also had increased nest success. This study presents a nuanced view of how forest composition (proportion of pine trees) of the Atlantic Coastal Plain in Maryland influenced ground-nesting warblers differently, and suggests that effectively managing ground-nesting warblers in this area may differ from other regions of Eastern North America due to its unique vegetative composition, structure, and history.\n",

I find that the great majority of texts, perhaps fearing that a more critical approach would lead to political and civic disengagement by undergraduates, present an overly idealized version of American government and politics.\n",

This relationship is driven by coordination among dedicated and independent institutions who have strong monitoring incentives and is more pronounced among firms with lower blockholder ownership and greater information asymmetry where there is greater benefit to monitoring. We propose that shareholder coordination promotes corporate innovation through a reduction in managerial agency problems. Overall, our results are consistent with the notion that greater shareholder coordination enables diffuse shareholders to monitor managers more effectively and enhances corporate innovation.\n",

        "abstract": "Concepts regarding effects of recurrent natural disturbances and subsequent responses of communities are central to ecology and conservation biology. Tropical cyclones constitute major disturbances producing direct effects (damage, mortality) in many coastal communities worldwide. Subsequent reassembly involves changes in composition and abundance for which the underlying mechanisms (deterministic and stochastic processes) are still not clear, especially for mobile organisms. We examined tropical cyclone\u2010induced changes in composition and reassembly of entire insect communities in 16 Louisiana coastal salt marshes before and after Hurricane Isaac in 2012 and 2013. We used the Shannon index and multivariate permutational ANOVA to study insect resistance and resilience, \u03b2 diversity partitioning to evaluate the importance of species replacement, and null models to disentangle the relative roles of different assembly processes over time after the tropical cyclone. The \u03b1 diversity and species composition, overall and for different trophic levels, decreased immediately after the tropical cyclone; nonetheless, both then increased rapidly and returned to pre\u2010cyclone states within one year. Changes in species abundance, rather than species replacement, was the primary driver, accounting for most temporal dissimilarity among insect communities. Stochastic processes, which drove community composition immediately after the tropical cyclone, decreased in importance over time. Our study indicates that rapid reformation of insect communities involved sequential landscape\u2010level dynamics. Cyclone\u2010resistant life cycle stages apparently survived in some, perhaps random locations within the overall salt marsh landscape. Subsequently, stochastic patterns of immigration of mobile life cycle stages resulted in rapid reformation of local communities. Post\u2010cyclone direct regeneration of salt marsh insect communities resulted from low resistance, coupled with high landscape\u2010level resilience via re\u2010immigration. Our study suggests that the extent of direct regeneration of local salt marsh insect communities might change with the size of larger marsh landscapes within which they are imbedded.\n",

        "abstract": "The rest-frame far to extreme ultraviolet (UV) colour\u2013redshift relationship has been constructed from data on over $480\\, 000$ quasars carefully cross-matched between SDSS Data Release 14 and the final GALEX\u00a0photometric catalogue. UV matching and detection probabilities are given for all the quasars, including dependencies on separation, optical brightness, and redshift. Detection limits are also provided for all objects. The UV colour distributions are skewed redward at virtually all redshifts, especially when detection limits are accounted for. The median GALEX\u00a0far-UV minus near-UV (FUV \u2212 NUV) colour\u2013redshift relation is reliably determined up to z \u2248 2.8, corresponding to rest-frame wavelengths as short as 400\u2009\u00c5. Extreme UV (EUV) colours are substantially redder than found previously, when detection limits are properly accounted for. Quasar template spectra were forward modelled through the GALEX\u00a0bandpasses, accounting for intergalactic opacity, intrinsic reddening, and continuum slope variations. Intergalactic absorption by itself cannot account for the very red EUV colours. The colour\u2013redshift relation is consistent with no intrinsic reddening, at least for SMC-like extinction. The best model fit has a FUV continuum power-law slope \u03b1\u03bd, FUV\u00a0= \u22120.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 consistent with previous results, but an EUV slope \u03b1\u03bd, EUV\u00a0= \u22122.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04 that is much redder and inconsistent with any previous composite value (all\u00a0\u2273\u00a0\u22122.0). The EUV slope difference can be attributed in part to the tendency of previous studies to preferentially select UV brighter and bluer objects. The weak EUV flux suggests quasar accretion disc models that include outflows such as disc winds.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The initial development of Silicon Valley and its indigenous start-ups relied on various endowments, including abundant resources and a set of institutions and know-how inherited from previous industrial activity. This article identifies the entrepreneurial ecosystem that supported key tech start-ups on the San Francisco Peninsula prior to the 1960s, shows how the ecosystem developed and how it evolved. By 1940, a far-flung ecosystem\u2014from Santa Clara County to San Francisco to Washington, DC \u2013 was in place, well before the arrival of the Valley\u2019s first venture capitalists in 1959 and the establishment of the region\u2019s first high-tech law firm in 1961. Federal agencies and laws provided revenue and risk reduction. Local universities provided brainpower. San Francisco-based banks and their Peninsula branches provided financing. San Francisco law firms drafted organizational agreements and protected intellectual property. Without such institutional support, there would be no Silicon Valley as we know it. Silicon Valley\u2019s early high-tech start-ups were supported by an ecosystem that was developed for the agriculture, extractive, and transportation industries. That ecosystem was repurposed for defence-based electronics and telecommunications, and then transformed for the consumer world of calculators, video games and personal computers. The \u201cmaster cluster\u201d benefitted from being in the right place at the right time, and by inheriting the right ecosystem. KEYWORDS: Silicon Valley Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Clusters High-tech Acknowledgments The article benefitted from the comments of two anonymous reviewers. I also thank Henry Etzkowitz, Martin Kenney, Gavin Wright, and attendees at the Stanford Humanities Center Approaches to Capitalism Workshop and the National Museum of American History\u2019s Lemelson Center Colloquium for helpful comments on earlier versions of the manuscript, and Jack Wenstrand for arranging access to the Hewlett-Packard papers.

        "abstract": "Intestinal microbiota perform many functions for their host, but among the most important is their role in metabolism, especially the conversion of recalcitrant biomass that the host is unable to digest into bioavailable compounds. Most studies have focused on the assistance gut microbiota provide in the metabolism of carbohydrates, however, their role in host amino acid metabolism is poorly understood. We conducted an experiment onMus musculususing 16S rRNA gene sequencing and carbon isotope analysis of essential amino acids (AAESS) to quantify the community composition of gut microbiota and the contribution of carbohydrate carbon used by the gut microbiome to synthesize AAESSthat are assimilated by mice to build skeletal muscle tissue. The relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes inversely varied as a function of dietary macromolecular content, with Firmicutes dominating when mice were fed low-protein diets that contained the highest proportions of simple carbohydrates (sucrose). Mixing models estimated that the microbial contribution of AAESSto mouse muscle varied from less than 5% (threonine, lysine, and phenylalanine) to approximately 60% (valine) across diet treatments, with the Firmicute-dominated microbiome associated with the greatest contribution. Our results show that intestinal microbes can provide a significant source of the AAESStheir host uses to synthesize structural tissues. The role that gut microbiota play in the amino acid metabolism of animals that consume protein-deficient diets is likely a significant but under-recognized aspect of foraging ecology and physiology.\n",

        "abstract": "## Objective:\nTo determine the effects of acute creatine monohydrate supplementation on arterial stiffness (AS) and skeletal muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2). There is a void in our knowledge on the impact of acute creatine monohydrate supplementation on AS in the major elastic arteries. In addition, there is a dearth of findings on the effects of creatine supplementation on SmO2 in the lower leg. Data have indicated that creatine supplementation can result in an increase in lower leg anterior compartment pressure at rest and post exercise. Although the increased pressures seen during these studies were not pathological, this and additional factors associated with creatine supplementation could possibly effect SmO2 during exercise and recovery.\n\n## Methods:\n20 male, physically active participants were randomized in a double\u2010blind fashion to placebo (PL) (n=10, 22.9\u00b13.1 yrs.) or creatine (CM) (n=10, 21.3\u00b11.8 yrs.) groups. Subjects received 0.3 g/kg/day creatine monohydrate or placebo in gelatin capsules for 7 days. Ultrasonography of the carotid artery, applanation tonometry, submaximal exercise tests (10 minute treadmill activity at 3.7 mph and 9% incline), SmO2, and lower leg pain (analog visual scale and pain test algometer) assessments were conducted at baseline and on day 7 of the study period.\n\n## Results:\nThere were baseline differences in central systolic blood pressure (cSBP) (mean difference, 109; 95% confidence interval (CI) 105 to 113, vs. mean difference, 130; 95% CI 114 to 146, p < 0.05) between the PLA and CM groups, respectively. Following the intervention, there were no significant differences between PL and CM in arterial stiffness indices between the groups. There was a significant group effect (P<0.03) but no significant effect of supplementation (P>0.05) on the % change in SmO2 during the exercise tests (CM: pre 66.49 \u00b1 30.54; post 59.61 \u00b1 23.87 vs. PL: pre 39.87 \u00b1 16.72; post 38.51 \u00b1 26.95 % change SmO2; M \u00b1 SD). Percent fat free mass (FFM) was significantly increased (mean, 68.5\u00b17.5%; 95% CI 62.1% to 72.9%, to mean 69.3\u00b17.5% 95% CI 62.9% to 73.6%, P<0.05) in the CM group only. There were no other significant changes in anthropometric measurements.\n\n## Conclusions:\nUsing a randomly controlled, double\u2010blind trial with validated measurements of AS and SmO2, acute creatine supplementation does not appear to impact vascular compliance or oxygen saturation in skeletal muscle in young, healthy males.\n",

        "abstract": "## ABSTRACT\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) has become a rapidly growing global public health problem. It causes premature loss of lives, the interruption of workforce supply pipelines, increased care demand for injured elderly people, and other socio-economic burdens. This paper presents the importance of and the need for a national comprehensive TBI database that incorporates geospatial data components to help tackle the TBI epidemic. It calls for legislative and research actions to enhance the U.S. TBI data infrastructure to make the use of GIS in TBI research possible. Further, it proposes a multi-tiered conceptual framework and associated implementation strategy to establish the proposed national TBI data structure. The enhanced U.S. TBI data infrastructure will provide a feasible platform to utilize the GIS capabilities for location-based mapping, data analysis and modelling. Precision TBI research, targeted outreach, and education will likely facilitate more effective prevention and better care delivery. The enhanced U.S. TBI database infrastructure will serve as a guiding model for other developing nations. Global concerted efforts on TBI can help improve the overall quality of living around the world.\n\n**KEYWORDS:** TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury), public health, GIS, geospatial health, geospatial perspective.\n\n## TBI landscape: prevalence, direct and indirect socio-economic cost\nBrain injuries present an urgent and severe challenge for modern medicine in general (Katarzyna, Agata, and Marcin Citation2019). Approximately 69 million people sustain a TBI each year globally (Dewan et al. Citation2019). Approximately half of the population is likely to have one or more TBI over a lifetime (Maas et al. Citation2017). There has also been a rapid increase in TBI cases, contributing to it as a worldwide public health problem. According to the WHO (Citation2006), TBI will surpass many diseases as the major cause of death and disability. As less developed nations are engaging and experiencing rapid economic transformation, TBI problems have become not only a pressing public health issue but also a global epidemic mental health problem and socio-economic burden.\n\nIn the U.S., TBI is a leading cause of death and lifelong disability among children and young adults, according to the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is a growing \u2018silent epidemic\u2019 because the complications from TBI, such as impaired cognition and memory, are often not apparent, and because public awareness about TBI is very limited (National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Citation2010). From 2002\u20132006, approximately 1.74 million people suffered a TBI each year. Fast forward, 2.87 million people in 2014 have sustained TBI annually (Taylor et al. Citation2017), which represents a 67% increase in less than a decade.\n\nBeyond the prevalent nature, the healthcare and broader socio-economic cost of TBI has been monumental. From a health perspective, the fundamental hallmark that we humans stand out from the rest of the life forms on earth is our mental capacity. It is impossible to overstate the importance of brain functions in all facets of our daily life. TBI can severely disrupt an individual\u2019s cognitive, social, emotional, and physical functioning and cause extensive and prolonged deficits (Tomaszczyk et al. Citation2014; Vitaz et al. Citation2003). Moderate and severe TBI often rob us of parts of that capacity suddenly and prematurely. The impact of TBI is not only the acute bodily impairment and cognitive dysfunctions of the injured person, but also many-fold long-term family and societal impacts. Cognitive, emotional, and functional problems after TBI are often extensive and long-lasting (Vitaz et al. Citation2003). The long-term prognosis of severe or recurrent TBI remains poor (Sowers et al. Citation2018). Research from the 1990s reported estimates, the direct acute care cost ranges from 25,174 USD to 81,153 USD per case (McGregor and Pentland Citation1997), and projected post-acute rehabilitation programme annual life care cost (1991 dollars) ranges from 222,600 USD to 450,000 USD (Ashley et al. Citation1997). A recent study on the global macroeconomic burden of road injuries for 166 countries projects 1.8 USD trillion (2010 US$) in 2015\u201330 (Chen et al. Citation2019).\n\nThe prevalence and serious consequences of TBI have imposed a mounting global socio-economic burden, beyond direct medical cost. In past decades, it was estimated that 44% of the world\u2019s road deaths occurred in Asia, and road traffic injuries were on the verge of an epidemic (Hyder et al. Citation2007). The two most populated countries, China and India, have been going through rapid economic growth in recent decades, but there have been no recent data on the TBI care cost. Geospatial analysis tools are rarely used in health policy management in China (Kim, Zhang, and Lee Citation2018). The U.S. and many other developed nations have taken efforts in monitoring and studying the causes and impacts of TBI, while many in non-western developing countries attribute injuries to supernatural causes (Mbakile-Mahlanza, Manderson, and Ponsford Citation2015).\n\nTBI alters the workforce supply and productivity, and the resources allocation and consumption of a society. Frequently, TBI affects more kids, youth, and elderly people. It is a common cause of death and disability from trauma in children and adolescents in the United States (Rivara et al. Citation2011; Stanley et al. Citation2012; Courtney-Long et al. Citation2015). According to the CDC, in 2014 about 2.87 million TBI-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths occurred in the United States, and over 837,000 cases were related to children.\n\nUnderstanding the interwoven relationship between mental, physical, and social health at various levels of analysis is critical to the overall wellbeing of people, societies, and nations (Maier and al'Absi Citation2017; Somers, Rowe, and Clay Citation2009). For example, many TBI patients never recover full social independence (Humphreys et al. Citation2013). One study indicates a 60.4% unemployment rate among those with moderate to severe TBI (Cuthbert et al. Citation2015). Beyond direct costs of TBI care, there are tangible and intangible indirect costs at the individual, family, community, and national level. Depression and psychological distress are often associated with TBI (Sigurdardottir et al. Citation2013).\n\nFurthermore, TBI represents the quintessential neuropsychiatric combination of effects in cognition, personality, and the risk for psychiatric disorders (Santopietro et al. Citation2015). Naturally, the multitude of cognitive and functional deficits makes TBI patients more susceptible to mental problems. Neurological disorders are the most common cause of serious disability (Wong et al. Citation2017), and TBI is a leading cause of disability and mortality (Coronado et al. Citation2011). The estimated prevalence of depression after TBI is over 50% (Moldover, Goldberg, and Prout Citation2004). In 2013, a large study based on the data of 1.13 million cases from 1977\u20132000 found that individuals with TBI (including concussions) were four times more likely to develop a mental illness, and in particular the head injury between ages 11 and 15 years presented the strongest predictor for subsequent development of schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder (Orlovska et al. Citation2014).\n\nConsequently, the TBI epidemic presents a reality that global societies are burdened with the premature loss of lives, the interruption of workforce supply, and increased care demand for injured elderly people, in addition to mounting direct medical costs. In the U.S., according to the CDC, both the young and old are affected the most, which burns the vitality candle of society at both ends.\n\nThe burden of healthcare, the potential of human capital, and economic development are intertwined (Chen Citation2018). The hidden cost is beyond calculation. It is urgently important to have an accurate and complete database to better analyse, visualize and understand the where, when, how, and why of the TBI \u2018silent epidemic\u2019. GIS is proven to be effective in location-based health data mapping, data integration, and analysis.\n\nThe prevalence, cost, and socio-economic burden of TBI provide reasons for incorporating spatial and temporal data and GIS technology. Consequently, this paper calls for a better TBI database infrastructure by proposing a concept for a U.S. TBI database framework to incorporate geospatial data. The expanded data collection and enhanced database infrastructure will facilitate the use of GIS in mapping out TBI distribution patterns and potential clusters and hotspots, which will lead to more precise and integrated research, targeted education, and more effective prevention.\n\n## GIS potential in TBI research\nGIS can be used in mapping and analysing potential TBI hotspots and associated risk factors, such as natural factors (road construction, topographic slope, speed limit, school safety, sport equipment) and human factors (violence, ageing, drinking and drug abuse, mental health and behaviour management). In fact, GIS has been widely used in other health and epidemiological research. In the past two decades, there has been tremendous development in applying geospatial analyses to health problems (Shi and Kwan Citation2015). GIS and artificial intelligence (AI) offer an immense emerging role for improving community health and healthcare (Shaw Citation2012; Kirby, Delmelle, and Eberth Citation2017; Boulous, Peng, and VoPham Citation2019). TBI research does not only need GIS utilities but also can benefit from its spatial-temporal mapping, data integration, and analytical capabilities. Four major reasons for using GIS in TBI studies are briefly outlined below.\n\nFirst, in response to rapidly growing TBI incidence, much research attention on TBI from both research communities and government agencies has started in recent decades. According to the Traumatic Brain Injury Model System Centres web site (https://www.tbindsc.org/), the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems National Data and Statistical Centre began in 1987 and has its primary purpose and focus on advancing medical rehabilitation. The Traumatic Brain Injury Act was enacted in 1996; subsequent state-level legislative efforts were even later. Currently, research progress has been made on post-injury treatment and rehabilitation care. Yet, globally TBI incidence continues to rise. The growing epidemic presents an urgent need for obtaining a better understanding of spatial and temporal distribution patterns of TBI. Are there any TBI hotspots; and if there are, where are they?\n\nSecond, TBI is a trauma to the human brain when humans fail to maintain brain\u2019s normal functions in responding to abrupt environmental changes. The changes can be caused by naturally occurring environmental or human-induced risk factors, or both. Geospatial locations, topography, road and weather conditions, neighbourhood socio-economic characteristics, population density, and employment rates are all important in better understanding the physical and socio-cultural environment settings of TBI incidences. GIS has been effectively used in other health issues for spatial data mapping and analysis, such as surface kriging, spatial clusters, and spatial filtering in dealing with cancer and other health data heterogeneity, risk estimation, and data regression of health risk factors (Meliker et al. Citation2009; Shi Citation2010; Meliker and Sloan Citation2011; Kontopantelis et al. Citation2015; Davies, Jones, and Hazelton Citation2016). Are different TBI clusters and/or hotspots associated with similar risk factors? It is an obvious environmental epidemiology research need to use GIS for TBI studies.\n\nThird, according to the CDC, the causes of TBI vary, but the leading mechanism includes unintentional falls, being struck by or against an object, motor vehicle crashes, and violence. In an earlier study (Hyder et al. Citation2007), it was estimated 44% of the world\u2019s road deaths occurred in Asia, and road traffic injuries were on the verge of an epidemic. Where do children and adults fall? What and where are the objects that cause TBI? Are road traffic injuries random or more concentrated at certain locations during certain times? GIS has also emerged as a key tool in predictive crime mapping and policing by many police services to reduce crime (Fitterer, Nelson, and Nathoo Citation2015; Jefferson Citation2017). Based on the leading causes of TBI, environmental settings are very important. Accurate and precise mapping of the environment and demographics associated with TBI incidences should be important and effective. Precision in problem-solving is an obvious argument for adoption of a spatial approach (Goodchild Citation2015).\n\nFinally, accurate spatial and temporal information can help facilitate emergency responding as well as potential predictive TBI mapping. At the same time, a better TBI database will improve more targeted research on the association or correlation among the response time from a 911 call to the arrival of emergency medical technicians & paramedics; the travel time from field treatment to receiving hospital emergency care; and the initial recovery time from a 911 call to the time when a patient regains consciousness, for those with moderate and severe TBI cases. Time is essential in the outcome of TBI, and only an accurate and complete database will help shed light on response and treatment time intervals to improve TBI outcomes and survival.\n\nThe geographic location, topography, weather, time of occurrence, time of receiving medical attention, and demographic background of TBI patients are all important geospatial parameters. GIS can use georeferenced TBI data to help better delineate and understand the overall TBI landscape (i.e. distribution patterns and underlying risk factors).\n\n## Enhancing the U.S. TBI database infrastructure\nGIS can and should be effective in facilitating better understanding and targeted TBI research through location-based mapping, data integration, and subsequent data analyses and modelling. However, GIS has not been widely used in TBI research, largely due to the lack of a georeferenced TBI database; the existing U.S. TBI Data Registry does not contain accurate location and time data of TBI incidences.\n\nCurrent TBI data collection methods do not require tracking of precise location data and various time intervals from TBI occurrence to treatments. The CDC data are disseminated in the form of only three broad categories: TBI-related Emergency Department Visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths (EDHDs). There have been no comparable or standardized data collection templates reported documenting TBI from first responders to ER visits to hospitalization at any local, state, or national level. The geospatial component of each TBI incident is only kept at local emergency dispatcher records or police reports. Therefore, researchers cannot find the spatial distribution patterns of TBI cases at county, city, state, and national levels, considering the fact that TBI patients can go to different clinics and hospitals.\n\nWe propose to expand the existing U.S. TBI data registry by including geospatial data to allow a broader and more effective implementation of GIS. This endeavour requires legislative support and actions. Specifically, the implementation strategy consists of an integrated and expanded data structure. The implementation process needs to start at the fundamental data collection level and may include developing standardized templates and overall database design enhancement. Geospatial variables may include the incidence time and location, and basic demographics of the TBI patient, such as age, gender, employment status, education, place of residence, and possibly other variables. These parameters make accurate and precise environment-based research and public outreach possible. For example, many important questions can be potentially addressed with the help of GIS:\n\n- Are there any geographic hotspots of TBI occurrences?\n- If certain clusters or hotspots emerge, what could be the possible physical and social environmental risk factors for various clusters?\n- What are the spatial distribution and reoccurrence patterns of TBI cases at different spatial scales: nationally, regionally, and locally?\n- Is there any correlation between TBI and physical and social environmental risk factors?\n- What are possible mitigation measures to prevent or reduce TBI in different locations if potential risk factors behind different hotspots are identified?\n\nThe proposed is a multi-tiered system. The U.S. TBI data infrastructure for data collection and dissemination promotes an optimal allocation of human and financial resources on TBI care management and precision medical research. Conceptually, it consists of four major tiers (see Figure 1).\n\n**Figure 1.** Topology of the proposed U.S. TBI data infrastructure framework.\n\nThe first tier is data collection, and it can be done by both emergency first responders and hospital and other care facility staff. The second tier is data compilation and database development, and it is done by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The third tier is a data dissemination portal, which is the CDC, in collaboration with the HHS and possibly other government agencies. The final tier encompasses the back-end data users, including researchers, policymakers, and the general public.\n\nIn addition to the conceptual framework, an overall implementation strategy is also important and is outlined in Figure 2. The implementation strategy consists of unified and standardized templates designed for data collection and public access. For data collection, geospatial location could be accurate GPS coordinates (outside of a city limit) or general street address or nearest road intersection of TBI incidents (within city limit). Other geospatial data such as smartphone apps may include environmental factors (weather, topography), employment, contextual social environment setting (home, road, workplace, commercial, school), and general demographic info (age, gender, ethnicity).\n\n**Figure 2.** TBI data collection and dissemination templates and data variables.\n\nFirst responders and hospitals face different kinds of urgency and have different amounts of time to collect data. Time is critical for TBI patients' survival. The time window from sustaining the injury to receiving medical services often draws a vital line between recovery and disability, or between life and death for some cases. Therefore, medical first responders\u2019 data logging time should be brief, or done retrospectively, primarily recording accurate location data. Accurate geographic locations of TBI incidence can be easily obtained and recorded by emergency medical and law enforcement first responders. Most smartphones can have a good GPS app, where time and coordinates can be easily extracted from in-situ photos and videos. Police may be able to help log more information about the incident and demographics. Hospitals can add more information as needed.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. TBI data are compiled by the HHS. A standard database format across the nation can be established so that the on-site and hospital data can be easily combined into a complete TBI database. This proposed TBI database framework will build upon the currently existing one, preserving the continuity with two minor revisions. To protect patients\u2019 privacy, it would be a good practice to establish a national TBI case digital ID for each patient, instead of using the SSN or driver\u2019s license ID, to safeguard identifiable personal information. In addition, State ID can be created and incorporated into the database. For example, MD as the text ID or 7 as the numerical ID for Maryland, by the date of admission to the Union. State ID will be useful for quick access and double safeguard of spatial data quality control. Not everyone is familiar with the GPS longitudes in the western hemisphere. State ID will help spot data entry errors.\n\nPublic data sharing is done at the CDC. The CDC analysts can double-check again to make sure specific private identification information is filtered out (stored in the system, but not accessible by the general public). National data management, preliminary and aggregated analyses can be done as needed for the access of the general public and research community. This way, data will be scalable and accessible at different spatial resolutions and scales, such as county, city, state, and national level.\n\n## Discussion and conclusion\nThe complex web of risk factors in the modern environment and associated dynamic changes have caused and will continue to cause many public health problems. TBI is one of the notably rapid-growing pandemic public health issues due to rapid globalization and increased human mobility. Analyses and visualization of health data with geospatial references can present far more accurate pictures of TBI in the U.S. For example, GIS can be successfully used to map the mobility, mortality, and hospitalization rates of TBI cases (Colantonio et al. Citation2011; Hu et al. Citation2013) and significantly improve quality and efficacy in health research (Shaw and McGuire Citation2017). Accurate geospatial data collection and an enhanced TBI database can expand the uses of GIS to help deliver better public education, preventative measures, and TBI healthcare guidelines.\n\nLegislative actions to improve the U.S. national TBI database infrastructure and utilization of GIS in TBI research are of far-reaching significance. Comprehensive understanding of TBI facilitates integrated research, effective prevention, better care, and broader support for the survivors. Geospatial data components of the TBI database will allow interdisciplinary collaborative research and concerted efforts among healthcare providers, researchers, health informatics and GIS professionals, patients, and caregivers in tackling this growing public health problem. TBI is not just a pressing public health issue; it imposes significantly adverse impacts on mental health and socio-economic development. Expanding the existing U.S. TBI data infrastructure is not only necessary but also significant in guiding other nations. In time, geospatial data and GIS can play a significant role in TBI research and prevention, subsequently, improving the quality of life globally.\n\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\n",

        "abstract": "One of the most common comorbidities associated with diabetes mellitus is diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), which is the progressive degeneration of peripheral nerves. The manner in which DPN develops and the underlying mechanisms of peripheral nerve degeneration are currently unknown. Our lab has characterized a glucose\u2010induced model of DPN in zebrafish (Danio rerio) in which we observe defasciculation/degeneration of motor axons, decreased myelination, and a decrease in ensheathment by perineurial glia. Currently, we are interested in characterizing the molecular pathways involved in the degeneration we observe. To accomplish this, we are testing dexamethasone, a FDA\u2010characterized small molecule drug, in an effort to decrease the degree of nerve degeneration present after DPN onset. Beginning 5 days post fertilization (dpf) experimental larvae were immersed in 120 mMd\u2010glucose for 7 seven days to induce DPN. At 10 dpf, larvae were additionally incubated with 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and a 1:1000 dilution of dexamethasone. As a control, a group of larvae were exposed to the same conditions without the addition of the drug treatment.Tg(nkx2.2a:meGFP)fish were used to allow visualization of perineurial glia 12 dpf using EVOS fluorescent microscopy. The percentage of motor axons ensheathed by perineurial glia was measured and quantified using FIJI. An increase in motor axons ensheathed by perineurial glia was apparent, furthermore the number of perineurial cells surrounding the motor axons appeared to increase as well. This increase in perineurial glia is meaningful because these cells form the blood\u2010nerve\u2010barrier, have phagocytic capabilities, and have also been shown to provide guidance cues for axonal regrowth. Future work will focus on characterizing the pathways affected by dexamethasone to uncover the molecular mechanisms potentially responsible for facilitating nerve regeneration after DPN onset.\n\n## Support or Funding Information:\nSupport was provided by the Henson School of Science and Technology at Salisbury University.\n",

        "abstract": "Industrial hemp refers to non\u2010intoxicating strains ofCannabis sativathat produce high levels of cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), the precursor to cannabidiol (CBD). CBD has known health benefits and is being tested for a wide range of potential medicinal uses. When growing hemp for CBD, unfertilized female plants are desired as they produce high amounts of CBDA in their flower organs. Therefore, early identification and elimination of male hemp plants is imperative and allows cultivators to spend fewer resources on plants that won\u2019t produce flower and could possibly pollinate female plants. It has been reported that male cannabis plants can be identified weeks before they show any visual sex features using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), however the results from reported studies have been inconsistent in identifying male plants. Here, genomic DNA from thirteen hemp seedlings was analyzed using male\u2010DNA\u2010specific PCR primer pairs described in the research literature. Three different primer pairs (SCAR323, SCAR119, and MADC2) were used in the analyses. SCAR323 primers have been reported to amplify a male\u2010specific amplicon of 323 base pairs (bp); SCAR119 have been reported to amplify a male\u2010associated amplicon of 119 bp; and MADC2 primers have been reported to amplify a male\u2010associated amplicon of 300 bp and a female\u2010associated amplicon of 450 bp. PCR analyses showed DNA from all 13 of our tested hemp seedlings produced a single SCAR323 amplicon of around 320 bp, suggesting this primer set might not be useful for sex determination. A SCAR119 amplicon of the expected size was seen using DNA from 6 of the 13 seedlings. The DNA from the same 6 plants produced an amplicon of about 400 bp using the MADC2 primers, while DNA from plants that lacked SCAR119 amplicon showed a MADC2 amplicon of about 550 bp. After seven weeks of growth, the hemp plants revealed the presence of male or female reproductive organs. The presence of male pollen sacs correlated with the SCAR119 amplicon and the MADC2 amplicon of 400 bp, indicating these primer sets could be a useful tools for determining plant sex at the seedling stage.\n",

        "abstract": "## Background/Context:\nThis paper is part of the special issue \u201cReimagining Research and Practice at the Crossroads of Philosophy, Teaching, and Teacher Education.\u201d We propose that there is a vital connection in teaching between curriculum and memories that should be fostered in our classrooms. Because memories are alive and bring meaning to our lives, they need to be handled with care. Unfortunately, however, much of teaching risks to simply embalm what is already dead. We examine how the living work of teachers might reposition curriculum as a body of dynamic memories: a constellation of struggles and belongings, failures and accomplishments. The role of the teacher, in this context, is as a handler of those memories.\n\n## Research Design:\nOur approach derives from sustained interaction as we have sought to bring our scholarly backgrounds in philosophy of education and English teacher education, respectively, into dynamic contact. The methodology of the inquiry is mixed in that it combines teacher narratives (our own) with critical conceptual analysis, collective memory work, and phenomenology. Drawing on a bibliography of texts organized collaboratively by the larger research group, our main authors of reference are Freire, Gramsci, Anzaldua, Style, and Britzman. We also feature several fine-grained narratives that illuminate what we mean by \u201chandlers of memory\u201d in the educational setting.\n\n## Conclusions/Recommendations:\nOur shared philosophizing in this paper is a response to the concern that classroom teaching contributes to the deadening of curriculum as a source of meaning and an avenue for students and teachers to learn about themselves. In response, we propose the image of teachers as handlers of memory who work to cultivate and keep memories alive and central to learning. We recommend that teachers explore collective memory work (Haug, 1999) and reflective teaching narratives (Furman, 2015) as ways to get a handle on their own powerful memories of teaching.\n",

        "abstract": "L\u2010Ascorbate (Vitamin C), a primary antioxidant in plants and animals, is an abundant carbon source highly produced by plants so is an available carbon source for soil bacteria. We previously identified a novel L\u2010ascorbate metabolic strategy inRalstonia eutrophaH16 (Cupriavidus necatorATCC 17699) by eight enzymes up to three transporters; the first enzyme is a membrane bound L\u2010ascorbate oxidoreductase (LaaO). Which face of LaaO, periplasmic or cytoplasmic, is catalytic was investigated by complementation of anlaaOmutant with a cytoplasmic plant L\u2010ascorbate oxidase. Growth with L\u2010ascorbate of two of the three transporter deletion mutants was impaired but not abolished. The growth defects correlated with concentrations of L\u2010ascorbate or spontaneous degradation products in the media. Transcript levels of each transporter gene, fluorescence of mCherry\u2010transporter fusion mutants, and the L\u2010ascorbate and dehydroascorbate concentrations were monitored to observe the regulation of transporter genes. This work elaborates on environmental carbon cycling by a novel L\u2010ascorbate pathway found in hundreds of bacteria while clarifying transporter function in three different protein families.\n",

The involvement of L\u2010ascorbate as an antioxidant in processes within the body systems of mammals is well studied, yet L\u2010ascorbate can also function as a carbon source for some bacterial species.Ralstonia eutrophaH16 (Cupriavidus necatorH16) is a soil bacterium that stores excess carbon in bioplastic granules and catabolizes L\u2010ascorbate via a previously unknown metabolic pathway. Transcripts for eight genes were upregulated >50\u2010fold inR. eutrophacells grown with L\u2010ascorbate compared to fructose or succinate. Three encode homologs of enzymes in L\u2010lyxonate catabolism to \u03b1\u2010ketoglutarate. Based on annotated functions of the five remaining enzymes, a predicated pathway was hypothesized to generate a\u2010ketoglutarate from L\u2010ascorbate. Enzymes not homologous to the L\u2010lyxonate pathway enzymes were purified and characterizedin vitroby collaborators. MutantR. eutrophastrains were generated, each lacking one of the eight genes, and displayed significant growth defects when grown with L\u2010ascorbate. Support for a novel pathway for L\u2010ascorbate catabolism increases our knowledge of related enzyme functions and the involvement of L\u2010ascorbate in the carbon cycle.\n",

        "abstract": "Background: Ayurveda\u2019s preventive focus complements its strength with the interventionist approach of the biomedical in chronic pain self-management. Patient-centered care (PCC) using ethnomedicine promises greater patient self-management; however, few studies have examined environmental relationships and PCC in self-management of chronic pain through Ayurveda. Objective: To examine how Ayurveda\u2019s philosophical focus on whole system frameworks describes the integration of the individual and the ecological in tailoring an integrative patient-centered diagnostic and prognostic approach to chronic pain management. Methods: This qualitative case study conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews of Ayurvedic physicians from India (N = 10) and a qualitative inductive content analytic approach. Findings: The diagnostic and interpretational framework of the doshas supports the integration of the individual and the ecological through (a) the circadian and seasonal cycles relating mind-body awareness with diet, lifestyle (e.g., yoga), and breath (e.g., pranayama), and (b) biogeographical and ecosystemic regions relating the biogeographical and the ecological (e.g., desh) with the regulatory principle of pain and its physiological and anatomical perception (vata) in an approach that goes beyond treating pain etiology to a whole person PCC approach. Conclusions: The study highlights how circadian and seasonal cycles and evolutionary spatial-temporal factors of biogeographical and ecological regions are employed in patient assessment and self-management to support patient involvement. Recommendations for PCC in integrative chronic pain management include supporting patient ownership of their care through the dosha framework that relates the individual and the ecological in the patient\u2019s own life-context and supports co-creation of a collaborative plan of care using an ethnomedical framework.\n",

        "abstract": "e13587\n\nBackground: The lower Eastern Shore of Maryland is an agricultural and rural region with high cancer rates. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine if cancer patients on the lower Eastern Shore utilize higher rates of well water compared to individuals in the general county population. Methods: A retrospective chart review of all cases of colon, lung, melanoma and breast cancer diagnosed at Peninsula Regional Medical Center in 2017 was completed. Demographic and clinical information including family, smoking and prior cancer history, as well as residential water source were recorded. Individuals with residential addresses outside of Wicomico, Worcester and Somerset counties were excluded. Overall well water use for each county was determined using U.S. 2010 census data. Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to compare well water utilization rates in cancer patients and the overall county population. Results: 631 patient cases were reviewed and 384 patients were identified for data analysis. The majority of patients were white (81%), diagnosed with breast cancer (41%), and used well water (52%, n = 209). Cancer patients in the three counties combined were significantly more likely to use well water than individuals in the general county population (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 2.11, 3.16). In Wicomico county, 61% of cancer patients used well water (n = 140). Wicomico cancer patients were more likely to use well water than individuals in the general Wicomico county population (OR = 4.4, 95% CI 3.41, 5.78). No significant findings were observed for patients living in Worcester and Somerset counties. No differences in family, smoking or prior cancer history in patients using well water versus municipal water were identified. Conclusions: Cancer patients on the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland used well water more than municipal water. Cancer patients also utilized higher rates of well water compared to individuals in the general county population. Interpretation is limited by small sample size and lack of causality, however the results signal a need for additional studies evaluating well water use and cancer risk in this region.\n",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Over the past decade, increasing attention to the negative impacts of exclusionary discipline and disparities therein has led many state educational leaders to enact school discipline reforms. This study examined the response by school district leadership to a state\u2019s revision of guidelines for student codes of conduct. Data: This study leveraged longitudinal data on school district codes of conduct from the 2013\u20132014 to 2015\u20132016 school years across the state of Maryland. Codes of conduct were coded in an iterative fashion according to a common set of infraction\u2013response combinations. Research Design: Using a pre\u2013post analytic design, this study examined changes in districts\u2019 codified infractions, responses to infractions, and the overall tier of response. Furthermore, the study compared alignment between state guidelines and district codes of conduct while exploring variation in codified discipline across districts. Findings: Findings suggest that leaders in districts increased the number of response options available for most types of infractions, with the largest increases occurring for more serious infractions. While these increases tended to be driven by increases in the codification of less exclusionary responses, there were nevertheless sizeable increases in the availability of in-school suspension and removal/intervention. In almost all cases, school districts reported distributions of response options that were at a higher tier level than that recommended by the state. Conclusions: Findings are discussed in the context of current efforts to reform school discipline and the implications of such reform for implementation by district and school leadership.\n",

We individually and collaboratively explore how our students read us in gendered and racialized ways while we enacted anti-racist pedagogies in our white, female bodies. We draw on performance studies and our shared history with collective memory work to analyze our experiences, with the aim of offering tools for analysis that go beyond the personal to include recognizing the ways cultural scripts live in our bodies, and working to understand, disrupt, and rewrite them.\n\nNotes\n1 In the teaching narratives described here, Colleen's context is a small private college in an urban community in Minnesota, and Erin's context is a mid-size public university in rural Maryland.\n\nAdditional information\nNotes on contributors\nColleen H. Clements\nColleen H. Clements, Ph.D., is a lecturer in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. Dr. Clements\u2019 research focuses on social class and racialized identity, critical foundations in education, and anti-racist pedagogy. Her scholarly work primarily concerns a critical examination of idealized white femininity as a racialized identity in white, hetero-normative, patriarchal U.S. society and its relation to teaching in both formal and informal learning spaces. In much of her work, she draws on her background in theater, using performance studies and arts-based methodologies in her inquiry to examine the cultural and social role of dominant and counter-narratives in shaping human experience. Her teaching interests are in the areas of social class and education, critical social foundations, and anti-racist pedagogy and leadership. Her most recent research is centered on the question how to create inclusive curricula and pedagogical practices for anti-racist pedagogies to engage multiple and varying racialized identities in teacher education programs.

At SU she coordinates, teaches, and supervises in the undergraduate and MAT secondary English education program. Prior to her career in higher education, Dr. Stutelberg taught middle and high school English. She earned her Ph.D. in Curriculum and Instruction: Critical Literacy and English Education, from the University of Minnesota in 2016. Her scholarship engages sociocultural theories of literacy and feminist and critical race theories to study literacy practices and teacher identity. Her dissertation research took up feminist and collective research methodologies to explore beginning teachers\u2019 memories of race, gender, embodiment, and identity in the classroom.

        "abstract": "Undergraduate research is increasingly prevalent in many fields of study, but it is not yet widespread in mathematics education. We argue that expanding undergraduate research opportunities in mathematics education would be beneficial to the field. Such opportunities can be impactful as either extracurricular or course-embedded experiences. To help readers envision directions for undergraduate research experiences in mathematics education with prospective teachers, we describe a model built on a design-based research paradigm. The model engages pairs of prospective teachers in working with faculty mentors to design instructional sequences and test the extent to which they support children\u2019s learning. Undergraduates learn about the nature of systematic mathematics education research and how careful analyses of classroom data can guide practice. Mentors gain opportunities to pursue their personal research interests while guiding undergraduate pairs. We explain how implementing the core cycle of the model, whether on a small or large scale, can help teachers make instructional decisions that are based on rich, qualitative classroom data.\n",

Delmar High School, Delmar, DE 19940  \n\nDelaware and Maryland have a long history of commercial production of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) for the processing market. In 2015, we observed lima bean plants that had irregular tan lesions with reddish borders in two fields in Sussex County, DE. Lesions ranged from 0.4 to 2.0 cm in diameter. Approximately 10% of leaves were symptomatic, and severity ranged between 5 and 10%. Symptomatic leaves (n = 6 to 10) were collected in September and October from each field for isolation and evaluation. Similar symptoms were observed on lima bean plants at the University of Maryland Lower Eastern Shore Research and Education Center in 2018, and additional symptomatic leaves (n = 6) were collected. Isolations were conducted from six diseased leaves per field (n = 18) by placing 2- to 4-mm sections of leaf on potato dextrose agar (PDA). All lesions resulted in isolates that appeared similar in morphology. Hyphae from the representative colonies were placed on water agar, and after 24 h, hyphal tips were excised. The hyphal tip procedure was repeated once to obtain pure cultures. Six isolates from Delaware and one from Maryland were stored at \u201380\u00b0C until use. Morphological evaluation of isolates grown on oat agar (OA), malt extract agar (MEA), and PDA revealed conidial morphology and dimensions consistent with previously published reports of Didymella americana (Aveskamp et al. 2010; Gorny et al. 2016). Two isolates, De15-002 and Md18-06, were selected for molecular analysis. DNA was extracted from colonies grown on OA; the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was amplified with primers ITS1/ITS4, and the partial actin locus region was amplified with primers act-512/act-783. Basic local alignment searches compared sequences to the ITS (GenBank accession no. FJ426972) and partial actin (FJ426870) sequences of D. americana reference strain CBS 185.85 (Chen et al. 2017; Gorny et al. 2016). The ITS sequences of isolates De15-002 and Md18-06 (MN698269 and MN944417, respectively) shared a 100% similarity with the reference strain. The partial actin sequences of isolates De15-002 (MN820723) and Md18-06 (MN820722) were also identical and differed from the reference sequence by 1 bp (99% similarity). To fulfill Koch\u2019s postulates, four 3-week-old lima bean plants (cv. C-Elite) were sprayed with a conidial suspension (3 \u00d7 105 conidia/ml) from 30-day-old cultures grown on MEA or with distilled water (control). Following 28 days of incubation at approximately 20\u00b0C, lesions were observed on all plants that were inoculated with isolates De15-001, De15-002, De15-004, De15-005, De15-007, De15-009, and Md18-06, but not on the water-inoculated control plants. Reisolations (n = 4 per isolate) onto water agar and MEA were examined after 7 days to confirm morphology similar to the original isolates. Based on the morphological and molecular characteristics, the pathogen was identified as D. americana. This is the first report of D. americana on lima bean in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Lima bean is the most widely grown vegetable crop in Delaware, and in 2018, the state led production nationally. A new disease on the crop is important to the agricultural economy of Delaware, and the yield loss potential of this pathogen needs assessment in the region. This species has only been reported in 2016 on lima bean, in New York (Gorny et al. 2016). The author(s) declare no conflict of interest.\n",

The effect of adding water-soluble groups onto extractant ligands has been extensively studied to facilitate the efficient partitioning of 4f and transuranic 5f elements for the treatment of spent nuclear fuel. Soft, N-donor ligands exhibit greater binding affinities for the trivalent actinides over the trivalent lanthanides, making BTzBP ligands an ideal candidate in the search for extractants to be used on an industrial scale. To date, hydrophobic BTzBPs have been shown to exhibit physical and chemical properties that might be conducive to nuclear waste processing conditions. However, hydrophilic BTzBPs have yet to be reported. Herein, we show the synthesis of a hydrophilic BTzBP ligand featuring cationic water solubilizing groups attached to the bipyridal rings.\n",

        "abstract": "The positive relationship between leader behavioral integrity and an employee\u2019s in-role performance is well-established, but explanations for why this effect exists are still in a nascent stage. Drawing upon leader behavioral integrity theory and job-demands resources theory, the authors explain how leader behavioral integrity facilitates employee in-role performance and the boundary conditions influencing the relationship between leader behavioral integrity and employee in-role performance. Using multisource data from 209 employee-manager dyads in South Korea, this paper found support for the mediating effect of coworker support in the positive relationship between leader behavior integrity and employees\u2019 in-role autonomy. Furthermore, compared to those who perceive low job autonomy, the positive indirect effect of leader behavioral integrity on in-role performance via coworker support was stronger for employees who perceive high job autonomy. The findings emphasize the importance of a leader\u2019s individual difference (i.e., leader behavioral integrity) and job resources (i.e., job autonomy) facilitating the receipt of team members\u2019 supporting behaviors which, in turn, energize employee in-role performance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\n",

Fedorko, Brent F. Fedorko  \n**Author Information:**  \n1. Pivot Physical Therapy, Cambridge, MD.  \n2. Salisbury University, Salisbury, MD.  \n**Relationships Reported:** None  \n**Publication:** Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise 52(7S):p 863, July 2020.  \n**DOI:** 10.1249/01.mss.0000684888.45544.ff  \n\n**HISTORY:** A 57-year-old male was involved in a motorcycle accident, landing on his right side. Injuries included a flaccid right arm and hand, laceration of his right thigh, and a fracture of the 3rd metatarsal of his right foot. Patient\u2019s chief complaint was pain in right shoulder and neck and an inability to complete ADLs.  \n**PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:** Patient demonstrated flaccid right upper extremity with very little finger movement. Patient was able to achieve some finger flexion of all 5 digits and thumb opposition to index finger, although could not achieve pad to pad contact. All PROM of joints was preserved. Sensation was grossly intact. Patient tolerated initial examination well with mild discomfort during objective measures. No red flags arose during medical screening/systems review.  \n**DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:**  \n1. Cerebrovascular accident  \n2. Brachial plexus stretch injury  \n3. Brachial plexus avulsion injury  \n**TESTS AND RESULTS:** MRI of cervical spine without contrast \u2013 small disc herniation, MRI of brachial plexus with and without contrast - edema involving right scalene and adjacent fascial planes extending into brachial plexus as well as into right C6/C7 and C7/T1 neural foramen to confirm nerve root sleeve tears, CTA of neck \u2013 negative for artery involvement, EMG study showed that the brachial plexus was not avulsed, but not currently sending EMG signals to hand.  \n**FINAL/WORKING DIAGNOSIS:** Brachial plexus stretch injury  \n**TREATMENT AND OUTCOMES:**  \n1. Therapeutic exercises (ROM, strength, endurance, stability)  \n2. Therapeutic activity (work specific, ADL specific)  \n3. Neuromuscular rehabilitation (muscle re-education, sequencing, coordination, neurodynamics)  \n4. Patient education (home exercise program, home safety). Patient has been responding well to a treatment plan combining aspects of the above mentioned interventions. Has been showing greater activation of right hand and forearm muscles with ability to complete weak grip at this stage. Right upper extremity remains supported in sling.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTThis essay discusses my direction of Tony Kushner\u2019s translation of Brecht\u2019s Mother Courage and Her Children and the ways in which I transposed my understanding of Stanislavski\u2019s Method of Physical Action and my practice of Viewpoints to work with actors to make tangible the play\u2019s anti-capitalist philosophy: by having them score their scripts with \u201cpayment\u201d and \u201cprofit\u201d rather than the typical Stanislavskian terms \u201ctactic\u201d and \u201cobjective,\u201d and by using Viewpoints to craft character and scenic gestus, a term Brecht used to define physical actions and stage compositions that conveyed social meaning.KEYWORDS: BrechtStanislavskiaction analysisViewpointspsychophysicalEpic TheatreDisclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.Notes1. In her introduction to The Routledge Companion to Dramaturgy, Magda Romanska reminds us that the original Greek compound word \u2013 dramatourgos \u2013 can mean \u201cplay maker,\u201d but also \u201cplay composer,\u201d as the root word \u201cdrama\u201d comes from the Attic verb for \u201caction,\u201d and \u201ctourgos\u201d from the verb for \u201cworking together,\u201d which literally translates as \u201cwork,\u201d or, significantly, \u201ccomposition.\u201d Thus, writes Romanska, \u201coriginally, dramatourgos meant someone who was able to arrange various dramatic actions in a meaningful and comprehensive order\u201d (1).2.

I was trained in Viewpoints and Composition by Maria Porter, Professor of Theatre at the Long Island University-Post. Porter\u2019s training in these techniques began when she was one of Anne Bogart\u2019s students at the University of California. Her work was later influenced by further training at Eugenio Barba\u2019s Odin Teatret in Holstebro, Denmark, where she met Argentinian director Cristina Castrillo; they have worked together extensively over the last twenty-plus years at Teatro delle Radici in Lugano, Switzerland. Porter has said that the techniques I was taught are the manifestation of a marriage of disciplines (Bogart, Odin, Castrillo) within Porter\u2019s personal aesthetic. Thus, my practice is yet another permutation of the form, owing to my experiences with Porter, my separate study of Bogart\u2019s methods, and my own discoveries over the past seventeen years.18. Bogart and Landau, The Viewpoints Book, 12.Additional informationNotes on contributorsMatt SaltzbergMatt Saltzberg, MFA/PhD, is a teacher and director of theatre, music theatre, and opera.

Setting out from the intersection of the play\u2019s temporal affect and the play\u2019s setting \u2013 a movie theatre \u2013 this article builds on recent work on slow-cinema scholarship, particularly as it relates to theatrical exhibition, to explore contemporary discourse on both slowness and cinema. Going further, it sets this work against the backdrop of broader, multi-disciplinary conversations about the cultures of speed and slowness, before considering the particular slowness inThe Flickas well as its evocation of the theatrical experience. Finally, the article concludes by asking what it means today to attend the cinema.\n",

However, whenycan additionally take on the values of zero and/or one, limitations of the beta distribution and beta regression models become apparent. One recent approach is to use an inflated beta regression model which has discrete point\u2010valued components. In this article, we introduce a new class of regression models fory\u2208\u2009[0,1] that is fully continuous. This allows the entirety ofyto be treated as a continuum instead of discontinuously, which appears to be a new development for the literature. We use a Bayesian approach for estimation. We also illustrate the impact of different choices of prior distributions on empirical findings and perform a simulation study examining model fit.\n",

        "abstract": "Mobile money has been viewed as transformative in developing countries, because it provides basic financial services via mobile phones to people who lack easy access to formal financial services such as bank accounts. Given its accessibility, security, and affordability, mobile money has been increasingly touted as a promising digital solution for socioeconomic development in Sub\u2010Saharan Africa. Despite its potentially disruptive impacts, research on this innovation remains fragmentary. To take stock of what is known and to advance future research, a systematic review was conducted of 82 empirical academic studies on the socioeconomic impacts of mobile money in Sub\u2010Saharan Africa. Results show that mobile money, when widely used in Sub\u2010Saharan African countries, has enabled a wide range of socioeconomic benefits at multiple levels including household welfare, business benefits, community development, financial development, and country well\u2010being. In addition, the systematic review reveals multifaceted research biases and gaps in the literature and accordingly suggests promising directions for future research.\n",

        "abstract": "Perceived job insecurity is a critical job stressor that creates the conditions for negative health and performance outcomes for workers while potentially increasing health\u2010related costs for employers. Sleep quality, an important proxy of health, has been understudied in relation to the impact of perceived job insecurity. Using job stress concepts and a perseverative cognition model, this study examines the association between perceived job insecurity and subjective sleep quality while considering negative work spillover as a mediator. We expand our analysis to consider gender as a moderator of the job insecurity\u2013sleep quality relationship, predicting the relationship will be stronger for men than for women. Study 1 uses a nationally representative sample from the Midlife Development in the United States National Survey Refresher study consisting of 1031 working adults and a multi\u2010group path analysis to test our hypotheses. Results show that negative work spillover mediates the relationship between perceived job insecurity and subjective sleep quality. Study 2 uses a sample of 152 working adults who participated in three biweekly surveys. The mediating role of negative work spillover is replicated in Study 2. In both studies, no gender moderation is found. Theoretical and methodological contributions, limitations and future research directions are discussed.\n",

Osman (slosman@salisbury.edu)\n**Published In:** Violence and Gender, Volume 7, Issue Number 3, September 2020, Pages: 137 - 139  \n**Published Online:** 11 September 2020  \n**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1089/vio.2019.0057](https://doi.org/10.1089/vio.2019.0057)  \n**Abstract:** The purpose of this study was to examine empathy with a hypothetical rape victim and rapist based on sexual victimization experience and/or sexual perpetration experience, and participant gender. Undergraduates (n = 531; 385 female) completed the Rape-Victim and Rape-Perpetrator Empathy Scales (Smith and Frieze 2003) and the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization and Perpetration (Koss et al. 2007). Participants were categorized into four sexual aggression experience groups, which included \u201cnonexperienced\u201d (n = 220; 129 female), \u201cvictimization-only\u201d (n = 206; 185 female), \u201cperpetration-only\u201d (n = 8; 2 female), and \u201coverlapping\u201d (both victimization and perpetration experience, n = 42; 25 female). The majority of those with perpetration experience also reported victimization experience (overlapping experience; 84%), and the perpetration-only group was too small to test. Those with victimization-only experience reported greater empathy with a rape victim than those with overlapping experience and those nonexperienced, but the latter two groups did not differ. No differences were found among these three groups for empathy with a rapist. Women reported greater empathy with a rape victim, and lesser empathy with a rapist, than men. Those nonexperienced and with overlapping experience may not be able to take the perspective of and empathize with a rape victim to the same extent as those with victimization-only experience, perhaps due to less similarity in experience. Future researchers should consider those with overlapping sexual aggression experience as distinct from those with victimization-only or perpetration-only experience.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT On the basis of the self-determination theory, we develop and test an integrative framework that explains when and why customer incivility impairs employee service performance. Using multisource data collected through two waves in a shopping mall, we found that the strength of the mediated relationship between customer incivility and employee service performance (via employee intrinsic motivation) varied based on employee core-self evaluations; the negative indirect effect of customer incivility via intrinsic motivation on service performance was weaker for employees with high levels of core-self evaluations than for employees with low levels of core-self evaluations. \u6458\u8981 \u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u51b3\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u987e\u5ba2\u4e0d\u6587\u660e\u884c\u4e3a\u4e3a\u4f55\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u7ee9\u6548\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e00\u6548\u5e94\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d2d\u7269\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u8de8\u8d8a\u4e24\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e, \u53d1\u73b0\u987e\u5ba2\u4e0d\u6587\u660e\u884c\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e2d\u4ecb\u673a\u5236\u5f71\u54cd\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u7ee9\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e2d\u4ecb\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53d7\u5230\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u987e\u5ba2\u4e0d\u6587\u660e\u884c\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u5bf9\u670d\u52a1\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u8d1f\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4ef7\u9ad8\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u4e2d\u8981\u5f31\u4e8e\u5b83\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4f4e\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u4e2d\u3002 KEYWORDS: Customer incivility, intrinsic motivation, core self-evaluations, service performance \u5173\u952e\u8bcd: \u987e\u5ba2\u4e0d\u6587\u660e\u884c\u4e3a, \u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a, \u6838\u5fc3\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4ef7, \u670d\u52a1\u7ee9\u6548 Acknowledgements I thank Eugene Kim for his aid in data collection and in providing constructive comments and support during the development of this article.

Notes 1 The shopping mall consists of a number of small stores that are no larger than 500 square feet. While the ownership of the mall owns many of these stores and directly hires service employees to sell products across the stores, it also rents out or sells some of the stores to individual owners. These store owners have separate product suppliers from the ownership of the mall and autonomously decide what they want to sell and how they conduct their business. Due to the small size of these stores, the individual store owners often do not hire service employees; instead, they themselves play the role of service employees. Since they are independent entities within the mall, corporate management of the mall does not collect performance data of these tenants/owners. 2 We replicated these findings without including the control variables in the analyses.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nA variety of countries have instituted market liberalisation to develop their economies in the footsteps of more developed countries and changes in market system significantly influence a firm\u2019s behaviour and performance. This paper investigates the impact of market liberalisation on a firm\u2019s strategy of technology exploration in South Korea. We find that there is a U-shaped relationship between market liberalisation and technology exploration. In addition, we find that financial slack and industry concentration negatively moderate the curvilinear relationship between market liberalisation and technology exploration, while business group positively moderates this relationship.\n\nKEYWORDS: Institutional change, market liberalisation, technology exploration, firm Heterogeneity\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nAdditional information\nFunding\nByungchul Choi\u2019s work was supported by Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund (Grant Number 20201045001).

        "abstract": "Education could play a role in decreasing and mitigating damages caused by natural disaster. By analysing relationships between level of education and components of the World Risk Index, this study demonstrated an education\u2019s role in natural hazard awareness and mitigation. For this purpose, we analysed relationships between the components of WRI, created an education factor independent of WRI (based on PISA 2018 Science test results), analysed the frequency, magnitude and exposure of natural hazards of an extreme event character in selected countries and analysed the relationships between the education factor and WRI components among the countries. A detailed analysis was performed for 15 countries representing the full global range of natural hazards (frequency, magnitude and exposure to droughts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods (not related to hurricanes), mass movements, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis) and level of education. We found that the education factor (ranked and normalised to the maximal value among the considered countries) has significant negative correlation with the following WRI parameters: the Natural Hazard Factor (relative vulnerability, based on the difference between the relative and calculated WRI, ranked and normalised to the maximal value of WRI differences), susceptibility, lack of coping capacities and lack of adaptive capacities (all ranked and normalised to the maximal value). Results indicated that countries at low risk tend to be over-aware while countries at high risk are under-aware of natural hazards. Education can significantly increase awareness of natural hazards and reduce their impact.\n",

        "abstract": "Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification of proteins that plays an essential role in many cellular processes. Ubiquitination involves the attachment of the small polypeptide ubiquitin to target proteins to control their activity or stability. As a reversible modification, E3 ubiquitin-ligases attach ubiquitin to proteins while deubiquitinases (DUBs) remove ubiquitin from tagged proteins. Revealing the mechanisms that regulate ubiquitination/deubiquitination is important for understanding how cells fine-tune protein activity to control important processes and pathways. It is clear in animals and yeast that WD-repeat proteins (WDR) bind to and activate DUBs. In plants, however, no interactions between WDR proteins and DUBs have been reported. Here, we used BLAST searches to identify plant homolog proteins of a conserved animal DUB and its associated WDR proteins. Based on these homologies, we predicted that Arabidopsis UBP3, a DUB involved in pollen development and transmission, forms a complex with the WDR proteins At2g37160 and LRS1. Indeed, these three proteins could be co-immunoprecipitated when transiently co-expressed as epitope-tagged proteins in plant cells. At2g37160 also interacted with UBP3 in the yeast two-hybrid system and could enhance the DUB activity of UBP3 ten-fold in vitro. These results provide the first evidence that plant DUBs, like animal DUBs, are regulated by WDR proteins.\n",

        "abstract": "The Call for Papers for this Special Issue of New Political Science \u201cBeyond Citizenship and the Nation-State\u201d was written in what now seems an utterly different time: Fall 2019. This Special Issue acts as a bookend to \u201cIntersectionality for the Global Age,\u201d the December 2015 Special Issue co-edited by Jocelyn M. Boryczka and Jennifer Leigh Disney. \u201cIntersectionality in the Twenty-first Century,\u201d Boryczka and Disney wrote in their Introduction to that issue, \u201cseems to provide an analytic method and epistemological perspective that resonates with our attempts, as scholars and everyday people, to understand the rapidly changing and increasingly complex contemporary world.\u201d That Special Issue reflected their focus as co-editors from 2014\u20132017 on bringing intersectional scholarship from across the globe more centrally into the journal\u2019s scope. Building a stronger international presence for the journal in terms of contributors, reviewers, and audience remained a commitment of the editorial team led by Jocelyn M. Boryczka (2014\u20132020), Jennifer Leigh Disney (2014\u20132017), and Sarah M. Surak (interim co-editor 2019\u20132020) over a six-year trajectory. Intersectionality as a methodology and epistemology now extends well beyond the discipline of political science and academia and into mainstream political discourse. For instance, signs produced by the National Organization for Women (NOW) stating \u201cIntersectional Feminism\u201d appeared at the annual Women\u2019s March Global protests from 2017\u20132020. Intersectionality also travels well beyond the borders of the United States to operate on a more global scale, providing a powerful tool for critically analyzing what \u201ccitizenship\u201d and \u201cnation-state,\u201d the cornerstone concepts in this current Special Issue, mean in the twenty-first century. \u201cThis is my home/this thin edge of barbwire,\u201d Gloria Anzald\u00faa, a founding feminist political theorist of intersectionality, writes, \u201cthe U.S.-Mexican border es una herida abierta where the Third World grates against the first and bleeds.\u201d This border acts as a touchpoint for this 2020 Special Issue as one way to examine the push for boundaries defining nation-states and who belongs in them and the pull away from citizenship as unable, given its conceptual grounding in the modern period, to account for what membership in a political community actually means in a globalized world. The driving question for this Special Issue then is, what does citizenship mean in this age of securitization and globalization as the nation-state appears simultaneously to decline and ascend? Little did we know when conceiving this question in Fall 2019 the extent to which the events of 2020 would shape our thinking around such questions or the production of this Special Issue. The outbreak of COVID-19 was first reported on December 31, 2019, in Wuhan, China, right on the precipice of 2020. Rapidly, the virus spread across China and Europe, arriving in the United States in February 2020 with stay-in-place orders going into place quickly thereafter in the Northeast. Hospitals filled. The elderly in nursing homes suffered and died. Grocery stores became the only place to go beyond your primary residence. Universities and colleges quickly went to remote learning. Homeschooling went from a more marginal practice to the primary way young people learned as parents and guardians became full-time teachers. To date, 217 countries and territories report about 64.2 million cases and 1.5 million deaths, with the United States as the world leader in both categories. Amid a global pandemic, nation-states pulled inwards, closing borders between countries and often preventing travel within them. Citizens pulled even further inwards into their homes and onto computer screens. Social gatherings of any size disappeared for most as isolationism took on new meaning and intensity. This Special Issue is wholly a pandemic issue. While the articles do not focus on COVID-19, the first round of papers were due March 15, 2020, as lockdowns, shutdowns, and border closings spread quickly. Working with authors during this time, in particular, humanized the editorial process. We learned about the families, work constraints, and general wellbeing of our authors, engaging, as we all were, in a chaotic, stressful, and taxing time. We all felt the pressure of timelines, delays, and at points, the inability to think creatively as the world around us changed rapidly. As we draw the narrative arch of these articles, we cannot neglect the overlying situation of the world around us. This is not the way we anticipated culminating our time with the journal, but seldom is reality that of our making. Migration, a central focus of this Special Issue, has currently paused as borders close and states restrict travel to stem the spread of COVID-19. It will likely resume, perhaps in new ways, in the wake of mass vaccine distribution in 2021. Physical migration is a pattern of life shared by many across the world and a feature of human life accelerated by globalization. Virtual migration is a newer feature of contemporary human life, one intensified during the pandemic as Zoom became a verb common to everyday conversation. This Special Issue\u2019s authors take us across the globe from Turkey and Sri Lanka to Canada to engage with variations of migration as the entry point to inviting us to imagine a world no longer defined by citizenship as a vestige of the modern nation-state. The Special Issue begins with work of David Watkins, who engages with citizenship through the lens of political theorists of immigration who either critique or defend restrictive policies in ways that overlook concrete identities and insights from a critique of methodological nationalism. In \u201cIdentity and the Demand for Inclusion: The Critique of Methodological Nationalism and the Political Theory of Immigration,\u201d Watkins lifts up the importance of theorizing immigration with a fuller conception of how identity and its processes shape the subjectivity of immigrants. The nation-state\u2019s role in forming this subjectivity is of particular significance as moving across borders, where the full force of the state is on display, impacts immigrant identities in ways that differ from others while informative to understanding that of us all. Watkins does so through a critique of methodological nationalism, which \u201ctreats a normative justificatory vision of how nation-states should work as if it were a description of how they do work.\u201d Watkins argues \u201cthat greater attention to concrete identities and identity formation processes, divorced from the assumptions and biases of methodological nationalism can actually erode, rather than bolster, the case for restrictivist immigration policies.\u201d This article contributes to conceptualizing the identity formation of all citizens in terms of border crossings as opposed to ossified locations within the geographic and imaginary boundaries of nation-states. Rachel Yacaa\u0294a\u0142 George and Sarah Marie Wiebe provide an alternative understanding of citizenship centered within the relationship of humans and the natural environment. \u201cFluid Decolonial Futures: Water as a Life, Ocean Citizenship and Seascape Relationality\u201d challenges the reader to shift understandings of a state-based identity to one framed by the source of all life: water. Unlike our drawing of fixed boundaries in the modern nation-state system, this alternative is a fluid understanding of seascapes as spaces that open and produce and reproduce rather than stable, hardened borders. The rhythm of their piece mimics the ever-present motion of waves hitting a shoreline and enacts a form of \u201cvoyaging methodology.\u201d Weaving together vignettes of practice, this article engages a range of alternate methodologies, including interpretive methods, political ethnography, Indigenous storytelling, and community engagement research rooted in theoretical perspectives that challenge Western, anthropocentric settler-colonial narratives. Through this praxis, illustrated with photographs taken along their physical journeys, the authors open a space to allow the reader to imagine another type of world that is yet rooted in current arrangements. Water itself, required for life, is ever-present throughout the article, centers this space and rejects the human delineated boundaries of the territory of a nation-state. Instead, water brings together people and can be a space for community-engaged research that imagines and calls forward decolonized futures. While we imagine land borders, in ways signaled by Watkins\u2019 article, as we consider the modern expression of the nation-state, Shelby Ward uses the ocean narrative from a geopolitical framing to describe how water as a defining feature of how once colonized island states produce and reproduce national identities both historically and contemporarily. In \u201cThe Postcolonial State as Container: Lessons on Nation-Building and the Nation-State from Sri Lanka,\u201d Ward examines the discursive production and reproduction of the \u201cidea\u201d of post-colonial Sri Lanka as an island state through explicit and hidden forms of overt and discursive violence. Ward describes how the historical mapping and social imaginary constructions of colonial islands as sites of pleasure and adventure are reproduced today within the tourism industry. Given the history of violent political struggle and deadly natural disasters, this reproduction is possible only when recasting the narrative by reproducing the colonial imaginary of islands as exotic \u201ctreasure boxes\u201d containing \u201cexotic,\u201d historically \u201cOriental\u201d experiences and artifacts for Western appropriation and enjoyment. Ward then shifts to describe how to also read the history of Sri Lanka as a \u201ccaged-problem,\u201d a colonial sign from international relations which also draws upon this inside/outside narrative rooted in the European display of the colonial (human) zoo. This hierarchy is reproduced in post-colonization politics of inside/outside through the interstate relations, as is illustrated by the example of the civil war and external sovereign relationships illustrated by the international response to the 2004 tsunami. Ward\u2019s reading brings together the intersections of travel, war, human rights, and disaster relief by describing both the production and reproduction of the nation-state as a one of reproducing discourses of the island-state as \u201ctreasure box\u201d as well as embodying the \u201ccaged-problem,\u201d both rooted in colonial domination and international economic relations. The full force of securitization as exercised along nation-state borders emerges in Reha Atakan Cetin\u2019s article \u201cExternalization of the European Union Migration Regime: The Case of Turkey.\u201d Turkey hosts the largest number of refugees in the world, the majority of whom fled from Syria, generally practicing an open-door policy. As a candidate for membership in the European Union (EU), however, Turkey increasingly aligns its migration policies with the EU\u2019s securitized management practices designed to prevent migrants from crossing its borders. \u201cThis study,\u201d as Cetin states, \u201cfocuses on the ways in which the externalization of the EU migration regime securitizes Turkish immigration policy. It argues that the EU further securitizes Turkey\u2019s already securitarian migration regime by employing the principle of conditionality,\u201d in this case, membership in the EU. This historical case analysis locates the refugee or migrant within the broader dynamics of international politics where nation-states negotiate their relationships and determine who garners inclusion in such unions. The final two articles describe attempts to confront and leverage migration and citizenship through political actions and engagements. The first describes how migrants have challenged and integrated the state\u2019s neoliberal requirements by infusing their own methods of practice to secure citizenship rights. The second engages those who are already within borders, focusing not on legal status but democratic community participation. In \u201cFamily Reunification as an Earned Right: A Framing Analysis of Migrant Workers\u2019 Pathways to Neoliberal Multicultural Citizenship in Canada,\u201d Rupaleem Bhuyan, Kate Yoon, and Lorraine Valmadrid analyze the discourse of migration and neoliberal citizenship in Canada. Canada is unique in that it allows the application for permanent residence for migrant careworkers and their families after only two years of work. While this appears to be quite liberal in terms of immigration policy, and the government in recent years has touted a \u201cwelcome immigrants\u201d platform while creating language, status, and education barriers for those migrating in seeking permanent residence. Using a feminist, participatory action research methodological approach, the authors interpret the experiences of migrant caregivers who challenge requirements for permanent residency and family reunification based on exclusionary neoliberal, multicultural discourses. Through their framing analysis of policy documents and political rhetoric, as well as interview research, they find that caregivers simultaneously define themselves as neoliberal actors to leverage their \u201cvalue\u201d within the Canadian migration system while at the same time continuing to engage traditional ethics utang na lo\u00f3b, a form of reciprocal obligation to define for themselves their relationship with the state. In doing so, careworkers have leveraged their employment position to serve as an anchoring point for family immigration by leveraging the neoliberal discourse of self-sufficiency. In \u201cRace, Citizenship, and Participation: Interrogating the Racial Dynamics of Participatory Budgeting,\u201d Laura Pin assesses how municipal-level participatory budgeting practices in Chicago (United States) intersect with race and citizenship, allowing limited spaces for non-citizen participation with the potential for more substantial community engagement. Building upon the work of many of the scholars appearing in New Political Science\u2019s symposium on this topic in 2017, she uses rich, in-depth interviews and participant observations to understand the impact of participatory budgeting, which is assumed to increase minority participation that actually leverages engagement within diverse communities. While participatory budgeting does increase participation by Black and Hispanic residents, Pin\u2019s interviews show that this participation is surface level rather than a deep form of engagement proposed within deliberative democratic theory. With a specific focus on citizenship, Pin also explores how in Chicago\u2019s model, unlike many others in the United States, participation is both allowed and encouraged by non-citizen community residents regardless of legal status. Her research shows that undocumented residents face explicit and implicit barriers to participation despite defining and specifically opening participation to anyone living in the community. Pin concludes that while participatory budgeting does increase community engagement, as currently practiced it does not challenge or transform existing structural inequalities. For Pin, this is not an inherent constraint within participatory budgeting. In a very timely conclusion, she identifies how we see alternative forms of participatory budgeting with calls to defund the police by community members. For Pin, these, perhaps, hold a far better chance of \u201crecovering the radical core of the process and extending political inclusion.\u201d From theory to practice, this Special Issue calls forward the critical dimension of how identity forms the subjectivity of peoples globally when reimagining citizenship and the nation-state in the Global Age. Attention to the dynamics of race, class, gender, sex, sexuality, and the entire range of ascriptive identity variables humanizes the often dehumanizing processes of globalization when peoples crossing borders become numbers categorized to determine entry. COVID-19, of course, knows no nation-state borders or categories of peoples, though its impact has been most devastating for Black and brown peoples across the globe. As the global pandemic spread in 2020 so did a resurgent movement to address another ongoing, historic pandemic \u2013 that of racism. The September 2020 issue of this journal included a collection of essays and \u201cNew Political Science and Black Lives Matter Statement\u201d reflecting on the confluence of these two pandemics \u2013 racism and COVID-19. The articles in this Special Issue, in conjunction with the September 2020 issue, capture the impulse of progressive scholarship required of this current moment as we engage in theoria \u201cto see\u201d a way toward a better, more sustainable, just future.\n",

        "abstract": "Many animals acoustically communicate in large aggregations, producing biotic soundscapes. In turn, these natural soundscapes can influence the efficacy of animal communication, yet little is known about how variation in soundscape interferes with animals that communicate acoustically. We quantified this variation by analyzing natural soundscapes with the mid-frequency cover index and by measuring the frequency ranges and call rates of the most common acoustically communicating species. We then tested female mate choice in the t\u00fangara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) in varying types of background chorus noise. We broadcast two natural t\u00fangara frog calls as a stimulus and altered the densities (duty cycles) of natural calls from conspecifics and heterospecifics to form the different types of chorus noise. During both conspecific and heterospecific chorus noise treatments, females demonstrated similar preferences for advertisement calls at low and mid noise densities but failed to express a preference in the presence of high noise density. Our data also suggest that nights with high densities of chorus noise from conspecifics and heterospecifics are common in some breeding ponds, and on nights with high noise density, the soundscape plays an important role diminishing the accuracy of female decision-making.\n",

        "abstract": "Computation Tree Measurement Language (CTML) is a newly developed formal language that offers simultaneous model verification and performance evaluation measures. While the theory behind CTML has been established, the language has yet to be tested on a practical example. In this work, we wish to demonstrate the utility of CTML when applied to a real-world application based in manufacturing. Mobile manipulators may enable more flexible, dynamic workflows within industry. Therefore, an artifact-based performance measurement test method for mobile manipulator robots developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology was selected for evaluation. Contributions of this work include the modeling of robot tasks implemented for the performance measurement test using Petri nets, as well as the formulation and execution of sample queries using CTML. To compare the numerical results, query support, ease of implementation, and empirical runtime of CTML to other temporal logics in such applications, the queries were re-formulated and evaluated using the PRISM Model Checker. Finally, a discussion is included that considers future extensions of this work, relative to other existing research, that could potentially enable the integration of CTML with Systems Modeling Language (SysML) and Product Life-cycle Management (PLM) software solutions.\n",

        "abstract": "Well water contamination in heavily agricultural regions has previously been linked with increased cancer incidence and mortality. The lower Eastern shore of Maryland is a rural, agricultural region with some of the highest rates of cancer in Maryland and the United States. Our study sought to characterize residential private well water use among cancer patients on the lower Eastern shore of Maryland, and to compare private well water utilization between cancer patients and the general regional population. Retrospective chart review was conducted to identify patients diagnosed with colon, lung, melanoma or breast cancer at a regional hospital from 1 January 2017 through 31 December 2018. Residential water source was determined using residential address and municipal water records. Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to compare residential private well water utilization between our study population and the baseline regional population. The majority of cancer patients (57%) lived in homes supplied by private well water (428/746). Cancer patients were more likely to live in homes supplied by private well water compared to individuals in the general regional population (57% vs. 32%, p < 0.001). In conclusion, cancer patients on the lower Eastern shore of Maryland were more likely to live in homes supplied by residential private well water than the regional population. Additional studies are needed to evaluate well water use and cancer risk in this vulnerable region.\n",

        "abstract": "Eusocial insects have evolved diverse particle\u2010use behaviors. A previous study reported that red imported fire ants,Solenopsis invictaBuren, deposited soil particles on substances treated with essential balm, a fire ant repellent. We hypothesized thatS. invictamodifies inaccessible surfaces by covering them with soil particles to facilitate food search and transportation. Here, laboratory experiments were conducted to study the particle\u2010covering behavior ofS. invictain response to viscose surfaces or surfaces treated with essential balm or liquid paraffin in the presence of real food (sausage) or non\u2010food objects (acrylic plates).S. invictaworkers deposited significantly more soil particles on these three types of treated surfaces than on untreated surfaces. In addition, significantly more particles were relocated on viscose and paraffin\u2010smeared surfaces in the presence of food than in the presence of non\u2010food objects. The particle\u2010covering behavior on viscose surfaces was also observed in the field. Interestingly, when no soil particles were available, ants searched and transported food on viscose surfaces only if the surfaces were artificially covered with sufficient quantities of soil particles but could not do so on viscose surfaces without soil particles or with insufficient quantities of soil particles. In addition, ants actively relocated particles to cover viscose surfaces if the transportation distance was within 200 mm, whereas significantly fewer particles were relocated at longer transportation distances (400 mm). Our study provides a novel example of particle use by fire ants during foraging.\n",

        "abstract": "Disorders of the nervous system (NS) impact millions of adults, worldwide, as a consequence of traumatic injury, genetic illness, or chronic health conditions. Contemporary studies have begun to incorporate neuroglia into emerging NS therapies to harness the regenerative potential of glial-mediated synapses in the brain and spinal cord. However, the role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds neuroglia and interfaces with their associated synapses remains only partially explored. The flow of CSF within subarachnoid spaces (SAS) circulates essential polypeptides, metabolites, and growth factors that directly impact neural response and recovery via signaling with healthy glia. Despite the availability of artificial CSF solutions used in neurosurgery and NS treatments, tissue engineering projects continue to use cell culture media, such as Neurobasal (NB) and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), for development and characterization of many transplantable cells, matrixes, and integrated cellular systems. The current study examined in vitro behaviors of glial Schwann cells (ShC) and spinal cord explants (SCE) within a CSF replacement solution, Elliott's B Solution (EBS), used widely in the treatment of NS disorders. Our tests used EBS to create defined chemical microenvironments of extracellular factors within a glial line (gLL) microfluidic device, previously described by our group. The gLL is comparable in scale to the in vivo SAS that envelopes endogenous CSF and enables molecular transport via mechanisms of convective diffusion. Our results illustrate that EBS solutions facilitate ShC survival, morphology, and proliferation similar to those measured in traditional DMEM, and additionally support glial chemotactic behaviors in response to brain-derived growth factor (BDNF). Our data indicates that ShC undergo significant chemotaxis toward high and low concentration gradients of BDNF with statistical differences between gradients formed within diluents of EBS and DMEM solutions. Moreover, SCE cultured with EBS solutions facilitated measurement of neurite explant extension commensurate with reported in vivo measurements. This data highlights the translational significance and advantages of incorporating CSF replacement fluids to interrogate cellular behaviors and advance regenerative NS therapies.\n",

This economic injustice causes students to miss out on educational opportunities because they have to prioritize paying for their basic needs over textbooks. This article discusses a research study which explored students\u2019 perceptions of using an Open/Alternative Educational Resource (OAER), specifically a nontraditional textbook in a social work skills course. Overall, results support the notion that students are amenable to buying a low cost, nontraditional textbook option.\n\nKeywords: Open/alternative educational resources, alternative textbooks, social justice, social work education\n\nPages 226-240\nReceived 25 Jul 2018, Accepted 07 Dec 2018, Published online: 20 Jan 2019\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nBridging the gap between skills potential employers are seeking and skills graduates possess is relevant to Marketing Educators as they constantly search for strategies to improve the professional preparation they provide their undergraduate students. This research addresses this gap by providing one pedagogical strategy for use by educators. Researchers and Practitioners alike can benefit from and build on this research by continuing to search for and study additional strategies that may continue to bridge and eventually close the gap between skills sought and those possessed by students.\n\n\u6f5c\u5728\u96c7\u5458\u6240\u8ffd\u6c42\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u4e0e\u6bd5\u4e1a\u751f\u5df2\u7ecf\u638c\u63e1\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e02\u573a\u8425\u9500\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e0e\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u606f\u606f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed9\u5728\u6821\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u51c6\u5907\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u9610\u8ff0\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f9b\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ee7\u7eed\u5bfb\u627e\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u5176\u4ed6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4e60\u8005\u5747\u80fd\u5f97\u76ca\u4e8e\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7ee7\u7eed\u7f29\u5c0f\u5b66\u751f\u6240\u8ffd\u6c42\u7684\u4e0e\u5df2\u7ecf\u638c\u63e1\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u6700\u7ec8\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\n\nKEYWORDS: Employment gap, recruitment, job skills, pedagogy, classroom project\n\u5173\u952e\u8bcd: \u804c\u4e1a\u5dee\u8ddd, \u96c7\u4f63, \u5de5\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd, \u6559\u80b2\u5b66, \u8bfe\u5802\u9879\u76ee\n\nDisclosure statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article investigates the collecting philosophies and practices of William Henry Dorsey, a nineteenth-century African American collector and archivist in Philadelphia. Over many decades, Dorsey created an archive that documented black professional, artistic, and political accomplishments in order to preserve these histories, influence public perception of African Americans, and enable future research on historical black figures. In doing so, he established and strengthened networks between individuals and associations that shared the goal of celebrating and preserving black history. This article focuses on how Dorsey\u2019s archive enabled forms of sociability among the many individuals and groups that used the materials in Dorsey\u2019s collection. In focusing on the role that Dorsey played in collating, editing, and disseminating information about black achievements and contributions to world history, this article argues that Dorsey preserved \u2013 and therefore helped create \u2013 black histories that could be remembered, studied, and shared to refute the illusion of white supremacy.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nIntersectionality was developed by legal scholar Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw in the late 1980s to broaden legal and epistemological frameworks for peoples at the intersection of multiple oppressions, such as racism and sexism. The theory has since proliferated and grown across many international academic and public contexts. This article examines intersectionality in Crenshaw\u2019s original formulation to argue for theoretical and political insights when intersectionality is applied to the multiply minoritized position of Sikhs in the US and India. I argue for six theoretical formations that can illuminate what I term intersectional Sikhism: intragroup solidarity, intergroup alliances, postsecularism, untranslatability, precarity, and intellectual intersectionality.\n\nView correction statement: Correction\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis article began as a paper I delivered at the 2017 UC Riverside conference, \u201cSikhs and South Asians in the Public Sphere: Precarious Minorities and the New Global Politics of Religion.\u201d I am honoured to have been invited to present by Arvind-Pal Mandair and Paushara Singh, and am profoundly indebted to all of my fellow participants, particularly Anneeth Kaur Hundle and Seema Sohi, for their generous feedback.

For scholarship on critical race theory see, for example, Barnes (Citation1990), Calmore (Citation1992), Crenshaw (Citation1988), Gotanda (Citation1991), Matsuda (Citation1987, Citation1989a, Citation1989b, Citation1991), Torres (Citation1991), Williams (Citation1991), and Wing (Citation1990). For scholarship on the interactions between race and gender in legal contexts (including Black feminist legal theory), see, for example, Austin (Citation1989), Caldwell (Citation1991), Harris (Citation1990), Kline (Citation1989), Scales-Trent (Citation1989), Smith (Citation1991), and Winston (Citation1991). For scholarship on the connections between race and gender in contexts other than the law (including Black feminism), see, for example, Beal (Citation1970), Cheung (Citation1990), Collins (Citation1990), Combahee River Collective (Citation1982), Cooper (Citation1988), Davis (Citation1981), hooks (Citation1981), King (Citation1988), Lewis (Citation1977), Lorde (Citation1984), Palmer (Citation1983), Spelman (Citation1988), and Spillers (Citation1987). In 1851, the enslaved woman Sojourner Truth spoke at the Women\u2019s Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio. Her speech, which features the phrase \u2018Ain\u2019t I a woman?\u2019 (as a rejoinder to both white men and white women), is viewed as a precursor to contemporary work on Black feminism and intersectionality (Brah and Phoenix Citation2004, 76-78).  \n24 See Crenshaw (Citation1989) and Crenshaw (Citation1991).  \n25 Crenshaw (Citation1989), 140.  \n26 Crenshaw (Citation1989), 149.  \n27 Ibid., 149.  \n28 Ibid., 149.  \n29 Ibid., 149.  \n30 Crenshaw (Citation1991), 1245.  \n31 Ibid., 1245.  \n32 Ibid., 1283.  \n33 Carbado et al.

See also Aisha Beliso-De Jes\u00fas's argument for an \u2018activist-oriented decolonial stance,\u2019 one that \u2018draws on the relationality, conflict, tension, power, and politics of studying racialized religious and spiritual subjects' (Beliso-De Jes\u00fas Citation2018, 312).  \n50 Crenshaw (Citation1991), 1242.  \n51 Singh (Citation2017), 264.  \n52 Ibid., 260, 261.  \n53 Ibid., 261.  \n54 Crenshaw (Citation1991), 1256.  \n55 Anti-Muslim sentiment, discrimination, stereotyping, and violence of course did not begin with 9/11. Precursors include the stereotyping of Muslims and the Middle East as a result of tensions in the Middle East in the 1970s and 1980s, the Persian Gulf War of 1990\u20131991, the Oklahoma City bombing in 1985, and the explosion of TWA Flight 800 in 1986. To use an even broader historical context, each of these incidents emerges from and perpetuates what Edward Said termed \u2018orientalism,\u2019 as the stereotyping of the (non-western) \u2018Orient\u2019 as a place of primitiveness, depravity, backwardness, and civilizational inferiority. See Said (Citation1978).  \n56 Crenshaw (Citation1991), 1266.  \n57 Mahalingam (Citation2012), 302. For studies investigating the links between discrimination and the health of minoritized peoples, see Brondolo et al. (Citation2003), Brondolo et al. (Citation2011), and Nadimpalli et al. (Citation2016).  \n58 Ibid., 302.  \n59 McLaughlin (Citation2017).  \n60 Crenshaw (Citation1991), 1297.  \n61 Ibid., 1297.  \n62 Ibid., 1297.  \n63 Ratti (Citation2013), p. xvii to p. 31; for a focus on Sikhism, see p. 119 to p. 139. See also Ratti (Citation2019). The postsecularism I theorize exists at the intersections of political secularism, philosophical secularism, and religious thought and practice. These intersections are explored within literary space by writers writing under the political edges of postcoloniality, diaspora, nationalism, and majoritarianism. Their literary postsecular searches are individualistic, experimental, and risky as they gesture toward thought and practice that paradoxically combine the best aspects of religion and political secularism. To capture some of the paradoxes of postsecularism, I found the language of deconstruction helpful, as in Derrida\u2019s description of messianicity as an \u2018opening to the future [\u2026] but without horizon of expectation and without prophetic figuration\u2019 (Derrida Citation2002, 56). I describe postsecular moments in literature as requiring an immense imaginative manoeuvre, moments and decisions that are \u2018made out of human decisions and human risks, without the fixity of the nation-state. Such moments will not result in immediate juridico-legal change, but they can gesture to an epistemic change, which is unpredictable, and the trajectories of which are unknown\u2019 (Ratti Citation2013, xxiii). I believe the language of intersectionality similarly involves courageous imaginative manoeuvres. The manoeuvres of intersectionality can spur epistemic change, and can gesture to and recognize dynamic becomings whose trajectories we cannot as yet know. These gestures are driven, as in postsecular literary writing, by a kind of \u2018faith.\u2019 For intersectionality, it is a faith in justice that moves words and theories into action (see Crenshaw Citation2015).  \n64 Habermas (Citation2008)  \n65 Bilgrami (Citation2008), 50.  \n66 See Jakobsh and Walton-Roberts (Citation2016) for an analysis of how the Sikh concept of miri piri (the inseparability and mutuality of the spiritual and political) has successfully informed Sikh social activism for other groups (including minoritized ones) in Canada. See Singh (Citation2013) for a critique of the limits and potential of charhdi kala (perpetual optimism) for political engagement.  \n67 Bascaramurty (Citation2016).  \n68 Baldwin (Citation2017).  \n69 Goyal (Citation2018).  \n70 Ibid.  \n71 Consider Gandhi\u2019s argument that \u2018all reforms owe their origin to the initiation of minorities in opposition to majorities\u2019 (Citation1997, 82).  \n72 Mandair (Citation2009), 429.  \n73 Ibid., 34. Italics original.  \n74 Ibid., 34.  \n75 See Anidjar (Citation2006), 62; and Mandair (Citation2013).  \n76 See Said (Citation1978), esp. xv\u201349; 59\u201373; 201\u2013225; and the Afterword.  \n77 See Needham and Sunder Rajan (Citation2007), especially the Introduction.  \n78 Ibid., 429.  \n79 Ibid., 429.

For similar feminist arguments on the colonial differentiation and consolidation of identity formations, see Abu-Lughod (Citation2002), Rosaldo and Lamphere (Citation1974), and Spivak (Citation1988, Citation2000).  \n81 Spivak (Citation1993), 189.  \n82 Spivak (Citation1993), 191.  \n83 Ibid., 191.  \n84 Crenshaw (Citation1991), 1249.  \n85 Ibid., 1249.  \n86 Butler in Hark and Villa (Citation2011), 200.  \n87 Butler (Citation2012), 16.  \n88 Butler (Citation2004), 27.  \n89 Butler in Kania (Citation2013), 33.  \n90 Ibid., 33.  \n91 Butler and Athanasiou (Citation2013), 89.  \n92 See Hillman (Citation2004) for an argument on humanity\u2019s instinctive propensity for violence and war. In his essay \u2018The Fact of Blackness,\u2019 Fanon (Citation1986) describes the unfolding and violence of dehumanization through the mutually constructed and inseparable categories of whiteness and blackness.  \n93 Crenshaw (Citation1991), 1252.  \n94 Ibid., 1252.  \n95 Crenshaw (Citation1989), 166.  \n96 Sunder Rajan (Citation1993), 23.  \n97 Puar (Citation2011).  \n98 Puar (Citation2007), 206.  \n99 Puar (Citation2011).  \n100 Ibid.  \n101 Nash (Citation2008), 5.  \n102 Puar (Citation2011). All of the criticisms of intersectionality by Puar that I present in this paragraph are from this source.  \n103 Schueller (Citation2005).  \n104 For the mutations of racism into proliferating neoliberal forms, see Goldberg (Citation2008), and for its mutations under the guise of race-neutral positions, see Rose (Citation2013).  \n105 See Bilge (Citation2013) for the ways in which a specific academic feminist discourse, within a neoliberal context, attempts to depoliticize and neutralize intersectionality\u2019s focus on social justice.  \n106 Puar (Citation2011).  \n107 These examples of discursive representation are of course abundant on university campuses. In a recent interview, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak discusses the corporatization of universities and the strategies they use to mask that corporatization. Building on her argument that \u2018[g]lobalization takes place only in capital and data. Everything else is damage control\u2019 (Citation2013, 1), Spivak argues that universities are corporations that globalize capital and data, with their damage control \u2013 including the language and optics of diversity \u2013 consisting of \u2018mak[ing] the workings of capital acceptable\u2019 (Centro de Estudos Sociais Citation2018, 16:20\u201320:23). That is to say, \u2018you have to present corporatization as a jolly thing\u2019 (Centro de Estudos Sociais Citation2018, 16:20\u201320:23). In this context, intersectionality\u2019s co-optation and depoliticization by neoliberalism is all too apparent.\n\nAhluwalia, M., and A.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTIncreasingly trauma scholars are exploring the susceptibility of mental health providers to secondary trauma reactions. The current study explores the relationship between clinical social work practice with trauma-exposed clients and secondary traumatic stress among social workers. The intent of this study is to identify the role various factors play in the development of secondary trauma (also known as compassion fatigue). A simple random sample of National Association of Social Workers members were asked to participate. Participants completed an online survey that explored their exposure and responses to secondary traumatic stress. The online survey consisted of standardized measures including the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale and The Coping Strategies Inventory which assesses secondary trauma and self-care strategies, respectively (Bober, Regehr, & Zhou, 2006; Bride, Robinson, Yegidis, & Figley, 2003). The magnitude of work (the extent and intensity of time working with trauma-exposed clients) is assessed by a non-standardized measure which consists of clinical caseloads composition questions. Job satisfaction is measured by items taken from the National Association of Social Workers\u2019 workplace questionnaire (Whitaker & Arrington, 2008). 161 social workers completed the online survey. It required approximately 35 minutes to complete. This project empirically demonstrated that high-magnitude social work practice (providing therapeutic intervention to trauma survivors, i.e. military service members and veterans) is associated with higher levels of secondary trauma. There is also empirical evidence that self-care strategies can mitigate the impact of the secondary trauma. Educational and workforce implications for study findings are discussed.KEYWORD: Secondary traumatic stresssocial worker self-caresocial work educationworkforceAdditional informationFundingThe project was funded by a grant from The Atlantic Philanthropies (Grant #25461).\n",

        "abstract": "## Abstract\nThe Common Core State Standards for Mathematics have a widespread impact on children\u2019s statistical learning opportunities. The Grade 6 standards are particularly ambitious in the goals they set. In this critique, experiences helping children work toward the Grade 6 Common Core statistics expectations are used in conjunction with previous research to identify ways in which the Grades 4\u20136 standards might be supplemented or revised to help maximize learning. It is suggested that opportunities for children to perceive datasets as aggregates and to draw reasonable conclusions about statistical data by attending to context should be purposefully introduced in Grades 4\u20135. Currently, the Common Core does not have explicit learning standards for these activities in fourth and fifth grade. It is also suggested that teachers help students question their natural tendencies to focus extensively on the mode when summarizing data. The current standards do not specifically mention the mode. Revising or supplementing the Common Core in the suggested ways holds potential to make the Grade 6 statistical learning standards more attainable for children and to help teachers better anticipate the statistical thinking tendencies that are likely to emerge during classroom discourse.\n\n**KEYWORDS**: Aggregate, Context, Design-based research, Learning expectations, Mode\n\n## 1  Introduction\nCurriculum standards for Grades K-12 prioritize what is most valued and important to teach and learn. Different standards documents reflect different sets of value judgments. For example, documents from different countries reflect disagreement about the amount of emphasis to be put on student-posed statistical questions, probability language, and variability (Groth Citation 2018). There can be diversity across standards even within a single country; at the outset of this century, there were substantive differences in the appropriate grade levels and roles for many statistical and mathematical concepts across state standards documents in the United States (Smith Citation 2011). Differences across states in the United States led directly to the writing of Curriculum Focal Points (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics [NCTM] 2006), which advocated greater coherence and uniformity among state standards. The Focal Points, in turn, were used to help construct the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM, Common Core State Standards Initiative [CCSSI] 2010) for Grades K-8.\n\nThe CCSSM are currently the official learning standards for 41 states, the District of Columbia, four U.S. territories, and the Department of Defense Education Activity (CCSSI 2018). Some states that have rescinded or not adopted the CCSSM nonetheless have standards documents that strongly resemble them (Garland Citation 2016; Loewus Citation 2015). Hence, the CCSSM exert a sizeable influence in U.S. schools. Given their influence, it is advisable to continuously examine the learning opportunities they provide students and revise or supplement them as needed. When carefully done, such examination and critique can contribute to improved learning opportunities for students. In this article, I offer a constructive critique of the Grades 4\u20136 statistics standards of the CCSSM by drawing upon my experience conducting research related to this portion of the CCSSM and findings from previous literature. The standards to be considered appear in the Appendix. I argue that, collectively, evidence from these sources suggests that the CCSSM would benefit from revisions to the manner in which they address aggregate distributions, the mode, and statistical contexts.\n\n## 2  Source of Empirical Data for the Critique\nThe writing of this critique was motivated by recurring student thinking patterns I observed while leading two rounds of design-based research. Design-based research involves setting learning goals for students, charting a tentative path for them to achieve the goals, designing lessons to help lead students along the path, and continuously analyzing classroom data to revise the path as necessary to be responsive to the thinking students exhibit (Bakker and van Eerde Citation 2015; Cobb, Jackson, and Sharpe Citation 2017). I used this process on two occasions to guide undergraduate researchers in helping groups of children attain goals set forth in the Grade 6 statistics portion of the CCSSM. On each occasion, the research spanned a 10-week period. During the first week, children were interviewed to help set a viable starting point for instruction. During weeks 2\u20138, the undergraduates and I worked collaboratively to design weekly lessons for the children. Post-assessment interviews were conducted during the ninth week, followed by retrospective analyses during the 10th. Each interaction with children was video recorded and transcribed, and children\u2019s written work was retained for analysis. This article uses examples of student thinking patterns from the first round of design-based research (Groth Citation 2017; Groth, Kent, and Hitch Citation 2015) as well as the second round of design-based research to form a constructive critique of the CCSSM.\n\nThe undergraduates involved in the research were enrolled in secondary teacher preparation programs. They were charged with implementing the lessons we collaboratively designed. Undergraduates participating in the first round of design-based research described in this report were Rachel and Shantel (pseudonyms). The undergraduates during the second round were Jacob and Olivia (pseudonyms). Each pair of undergraduates worked together over the course of the project to plan, implement, and analyze lessons for groups of four children. The four children in Rachel and Shantel\u2019s group were Jonah, Rhonda, Mary, and Tyrone (pseudonyms). The four children in Jacob and Olivia\u2019s group were Allison, Andrew, Brian, and Claire (pseudonyms). Table 1 contains background information about the children. In selecting children to participate in the research, we aimed for diversity along the dimensions of race, gender, and schooling experiences. All eight children would enter sixth grade within a month after participating; the research aimed to prepare them for concepts they would soon encounter in their school curricula.\n\n### Table 1  Background information about children participating in the research.\n\n## 3  Aggregate Distributions\n### 3.1  Research on Students\u2019 Thinking About Aggregates\nLearning to perceive aggregates in datasets is important because characteristics such as average and skewness belong to aggregate collections rather than individual data points (Konold et al. Citation 2015). Describing and analyzing distributions using such aggregate characteristics are essential parts of statistical reasoning (Bakker and Hoffmann Citation 2005). Accordingly, the Grade 6 CCSSM expect students to \u201cUnderstand that a set of data collected to answer a statistical question has a distribution which can be described by its center, spread, and overall shape\u201d and \u201cRecognize that a measure of center for a numerical dataset summarizes all of its values with a single number, while a measure of variation describes how its values vary with a single number\u201d (CCSSI 2010, p. 45).\n\nOne robust finding in statistics education research is that it is challenging for beginning learners of statistics to shift their focus from individual data points to aggregate distributions. Aridor and Ben-Zvi (Citation 2017) observed, \u201cYoung students tend to see data as individual cases and measurement values as inseparable from an object or person measured\u201d (p. 38). At times, the graphical representations children use when asked to display data lend themselves to an individual case view rather than an aggregate view. For example, during the first lesson of the first round of our research, children had the task of displaying the scores they obtained during a game that involved rolling pairs of dice. Mary and Tyrone used one bar to represent each roll rather than grouping similar data values together (Figure 1). Their use of this sort of graphical display is not unique. During both rounds of research, other students at times used the same approach, and this graphing strategy has also been observed in previous studies (Bakker and Gravemeijer Citation 2004; Cobb Citation 1999). The graphs shown in Figure 1 illustrate the use of case value bars (Konold Citation 2002) to represent data. Although case value bars represent data correctly and support students\u2019 reasoning at times, they can make it difficult to see some distributional features that are more prominent in graphs such as dotplots that aggregate data more compactly.\n\n### Fig. 1  Case value bars produced by Mary and Tyrone to represent game scores obtained after rolling a pair of dice 10 times. Mary\u2019s graph indicated that she scored 4 on the first trial, 7 on the second and third, 6 on the forth, etc. Similarly, Tyrone\u2019s graph shows scoring 9 on the first trial, 6 on each of the next three trials, etc.\n\nWhen students do not perceive datasets as aggregates, they lack a basis from which to describe aggregate characteristics such as typical value. During her pre-interview, Claire responded to an item from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) asking for the typical number of customers at a bike shop over a 5-day span. Claire examined the data and chose the day with the highest number of customers rather than looking for a value near the middle of the others. Mary, Rhonda, Jonah, and Andrew also at times looked for the highest values when asked to determine typical values. Notably, some of these students were able to produce compact aggregate displays such as dotplots during their interviews. However, they did not automatically see dotplots as useful starting points for the task of describing aggregate features. Instead, they initially used them as tools for looking up individual points such as the greatest value, which Konold et al. (Citation 2015) characterized as a case value view of data. Their abilities to produce displays to compactly aggregate data did not automatically translate to the ability to actually perceive aggregates and their features.\n\nDuring our research, we prioritized helping children adopt more than just a case value approach when reading dotplots. We wanted them to see dotplots as portraits of aggregate distributions rather than just reference tools for looking up and reading individual values. Toward that end, during both rounds of research, we encouraged students to use words such as mountain, hill, peak, hillside, gap, cluster, hole, and outlier to informally describe characteristics of distributions. Doing so helped students think about grouping vertical stacks of data together rather than just looking at individual points and stacks when analyzing dotplots. For example, during one lesson, Brian circled multiple stacks in a given dotplot to indicate they appeared to be a hillside. We gradually focused students\u2019 attention toward clusters of stacks near the centers of data distributions, leading some of them to identify central clusters in data on their own, as Brian did during his post-interview (Figure 2) when asked to describe a distribution as part of an Illustrative Mathematics item showing data about the birth weights of 25 puppies.\n\n### Fig. 2  Brian\u2019s post-interview graphical representation for an item about puppy weights.\n\nSome work remained to be done, however, to help all students associate the central cluster of a distribution with its typical value. Although Brian produced a helpful graph for the puppy weight item and circled its central cluster, he did not refer to the central cluster when asked to identify a typical puppy weight. Instead, he justified his choice of 18 as the typical weight by saying, \u201c18 is the most popular number.\u201d Although 18 is a reasonable estimate of typical value in this situation, we hoped he would justify his choice by talking about how 18 is within the central cluster, and that an estimate such as 17 would also be reasonable because it is still within the cluster. Claire\u2019s reasoning on post-interview items was generally not as developed as Brian\u2019s. She still chose the highest value when asked for the typical number of customers in a bike shop over the course of a week, as she did during pre-interviews. Others, however, did justify their choice of typical value in reference to clusters of data. Allison, for example, justified her choice of median as a good indicator of typical attendance at a movie theater during a week by talking about how more of the data were grouped around the median than the mean.\n\n### 3.2  Reflections on CCSSM Standards Related to Aggregate Distributions\nDuring both rounds of research, the prospective teachers collaborating with me were surprised at the amount of time it took to help students perceive aggregate features and use them to describe the data. Ideally, the fourth and fifth grade standards would help lead students toward an aggregate view to make sixth grade work more manageable. However, the Grade 4 standard on representing and interpreting data only states that students should:\n\nMake a line plot to display a dataset of measurements in fractions of a unit (1/2, 1/4, 1/8). Solve problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions by using information presented in line plots. For example, from a line plot find and interpret the difference in length between the longest and shortest specimens in an insect collection (CCSSI 2010, p. 31).\n\nThis Grade 4 standard and sample item do not go beyond encouraging a case value view of data, since students simply select individual data points and compare them to one another. The Grade 5 standard on representing and interpreting data builds on the Grade 4 standard only by broadening the types of fraction operations students are to do beyond just addition and subtraction. Hence, the Grades 4 and 5 standards miss opportunities to help students begin to develop aggregate reasoning, which children can begin to build at this age (Aridor and Ben-Zvi Citation 2017; Frischemeier Citation 2018). Revising or supplementing these standards to have students identify clusters, gaps, and outliers in data they have graphed would help lay the groundwork for Grade 6, when students are to forge connections among the ideas of central cluster, typical value, mean, and median. Without this necessary groundwork on developing an aggregate view of data, helping students develop deep understanding of the content described in the Grade 6 standards is likely to occupy a much greater timespan than generally anticipated or available.\n\n## 4  The Mode\n### 4.1  Research on Students\u2019 Attraction to the Mode\nA step toward developing an aggregate view of data is to group cases with the same value together. In a dotplot, for example, this is done with stacks; each stack represents a group with the same value. Konold et al. (Citation 2015) considered this sort of grouping to be indicative of viewing data as a classifier, and noted that students are often attracted to the tallest stack of data when operating from such a perspective. We noticed the same student tendency to focus on the mode during each round of research, especially during the earliest lessons in each sequence. When describing typical values in distributions represented as dotplots, our students often chose the tallest stack of data. During the first round of research, students eventually kept track of game scores they obtained when rolling two dice by using dotplots. When asked to describe the typical score, they consistently chose whichever stack of data was highest. During the second round of research, students opened several packs of Skittles and kept track of the number of red candies in each pack using a dotplot. When we asked them to predict the number of reds that would be in a pack we had not yet opened, they all used the tallest stack of data to decide. The same attraction to the mode resurfaced when students described typical values in the context of graphs showing the numbers of siblings for each person in a group.\n\nGiven students\u2019 tendencies to gravitate toward the mode, we found it necessary to design problems to focus their attention on other graph features. During the first round of research, we altered the game of rolling two dice. Rather than giving each of the four students a pair of fair dice to roll, we gave three of the students fair dice and one student a pair of trick dice weighted to consistently roll 12s. When students pooled their scores from rolling their dice seven times each, the tallest stack in the class dotplot was at 12 rather than being within the main cluster of data. This started a discussion about when the mode is not helpful for describing typical value. During the second round of research, to stop students from focusing only on the tallest stack, we showed them a set of data with no stacks (Figure 3a). We focused class discussion on establishing the meanings of words like cluster, gap, and outlier in the \u201cstackless\u201d dataset because they had mainly considered only individual vertical stacks to be \u201cclusters\u201d in other dotplot displays. Having no vertical stacks prompted them to start to group points representing different, but proximal, values into clusters. When we reintroduced different-sized stacks (Figure 3b), students finally began to speak of multiple proximal vertical stacks as constituting clusters. We then were able to move on to asking students to decide if the tallest stack fell inside or outside the main cluster of stacks when we posed questions about typical value.\n\n### Fig. 3  (a) Datasets (heights of individuals on two soccer teams) intentionally constructed not to have multiple-size stacks to draw students\u2019 attention to features other than the mode; (b) dataset used to reintroduce multiple-size stacks.\n\n### 4.2  Reflections on the CCSSM Stance Toward the Mode\nOur experiences with students\u2019 attraction to the mode, along with those of other researchers (Konold et al. Citation 2015; Mokros and Russell Citation 1995) indicate that this student thinking tendency must be addressed. The mode is not explicitly mentioned in CCSSM. Mean and median are mentioned in Grade 6, where CCSSM state that students should summarize datasets by,\n\nGiving quantitative measures of center (median and/or mean) and variability (interquartile range and/or mean absolute deviation), as well as describing any overall pattern and any striking deviations from the overall pattern with reference to the context in which the data were gathered (CCSSI 2010, p. 45).\n\nAt minimum, it seems advisable to build the mode into the statement of this standard, given that many students will gravitate toward it, whether directed to do so or not. Additionally, if students began to identify clusters, gaps, and outliers in Grades 4 and 5, as recommended earlier, it could help put sixth grade teachers in position to ask students if the mode lies inside or outside the central cluster of data they are analyzing. Such discussions could help students make sound decisions about measures that are suitable for summarizing data in a given situation rather than automatically opting for the mode.\n\n## 5  Statistical Contexts\n### 5.1  Research on Students\u2019 Interactions With Context\nAnother student thinking tendency that consistently surprised my undergraduates was that children at times completely ignored the data in problems and responded solely on the basis of their beliefs about its context. This tendency first surfaced during pre-interviews each summer. For instance, when Tyrone was asked to give the typical puppy weight in the Illustrative Mathematics item described earlier (https://www.illustrativemathematics.org/content-standards/tasks/1026), he responded, \u201cWhen a dog is born, a puppy weighs 5 pounds.\u201d He did not consult the dataset, which showed weights between 13 and 20 ounces, in making this decision. Instead, his judgment was based on an incorrect personal conception of how much dogs usually weigh when born. When Andrew was asked to decide on the typical number of customers over the course of five days at a bike shop, he stated, \u201cI think there would be 87 average for the customers coming.\u201d When asked why he chose 87, he responded, \u201cBecause bike stores are kind of popular.\u201d Again, the data in the problem did not seem to play a role in his decision-making.\n\nThe tendency to seemingly ignore the data was not limited to pre-interviews. At times, children did the same thing during instructional sessions, even after they had begun to view the data as an aggregate. One instance of this phenomenon occurred as children discussed the data on soccer teams (Figure 3). Claire came up to the board and identified a gap and a cluster in Figure 3(a). She described the gap as \u201cthe big open area\u201d and the cluster as where \u201cthey are all grouped together,\u201d indicating that she had begun to focus on properties of graphs as wholes. However, she struggled when given the following problem:\n\nA player from Belgium was injured during the game. Using the data from the graph, write three good predictions for how tall you think the substitute player will be. Why did you choose these numbers?\n\nClaire wrote 79, 77, and 76 inches as her predictions, even though these values fell in the gap she had identified earlier. She reasoned that being one of these heights would help players \u201cmake more goals.\u201d She was not alone in choosing values in the gap. Brian chose 71, 72, and 73 inches because they were \u201cnot too tall and not too short.\u201d Andrew chose 75, 76, and 77 inches, stating only, \u201cbecause I think it is good.\u201d For Claire, and for some of her classmates, viewing the data as an aggregate was a distinct cognitive process from making inferences by coordinating attention to data and context.\n\n### 5.2  Reflections on Attention to Context in CCSSM\nStatistical thinking involves \u201ccontinual shuttling backward and forward between thinking in the context sphere and the statistical sphere\u201d (Wild and Pfannkuch Citation 1999, p. 228). This is not a trivial process for students to master. Our study is just one among others showing that students sometimes rely solely upon personal beliefs or experiences and disregard data when making statistical inferences (Jones et al. Citation 2000; Mooney Citation 2002). The thinking processes involved in shuttling back and forth between data and context need concentrated attention in school. The CCSSM do mention the importance of this thinking process in the third standard for mathematical practice, \u201cConstruct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others,\u201d which states that students should, \u201creason inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into account the context from which the data arose\u201d (CCSSI 2010, p. 7). However, this idea is not drawn upon explicitly in the statistics standards until Grade 6, when students are to \u201csummarize datasets in relation to their context\u201d (CCSSI 2010, p. 45) using formal measures of center and spread. As mentioned earlier, the statistics standards for Grades 4 and 5 concentrate upon extracting quantities from graphs and then performing mathematical calculations on them. This is unfortunate, since research shows that children can begin to engage in meaningful conversations about data in relation to its context at this age and earlier (Makar Citation 2018).\n\nResearch can inform the setting of learning goals that help children begin to balance attention to data and context. In one study of children\u2019s use of context knowledge in statistics, Langrall et al. (Citation 2011) noted,\n\nWe found that students used context knowledge to (a) bring new insight or additional information to the task, (b) explain the data, (c) provide justification or qualification for claims, (d) identify useful data for the task at hand, and (e) state facts that may enhance the picture of the data but are irrelevant to the process of analyzing the data (p. 47).\n\nFindings (a)\u2013(d) can be translated fairly directly into learning goals. Finding (e), on the other hand, points to a thinking process teachers need to be aware of helping students avoid; a learning goal based upon it might ask students to identify contextual details that are irrelevant to the process of analyzing data. In regard to finding (c), it should be noted that justifications students provide for claims can, at times, be based upon inaccurate beliefs about context, as we found working with our own students. Students have difficulty making decisions from data when the data contradict their existing beliefs about a given context (Masnick, Klahr, and Morris Citation 2007). So, it would be desirable to set a goal that students should learn to synthesize statistical and contextual knowledge, at times confronting data that contradict their beliefs about a context.\n\n## 6  Conclusion\nOverall, it is encouraging that the CCSSM include attention to statistical thinking in Grades 4\u20136. However, the Grade 6 expectations seem overwhelming in light of the minimal statistics learning standards in the previous two grade levels. It would be helpful for students to begin to identify aggregates and shuttle back and forth between data and context before they reach sixth grade. Such activities could be done as they construct the types of statistical displays mentioned in the fourth and fifth grade CCSSM. Assigning learning standards to such activities could increase the likelihood they will be done widely across classrooms. By engaging in such activities, students can be in better position to satisfy Grade 6 learning standards, such as deciding on the most appropriate measure of center for a given dataset and context.\n\nRevising the CCSSM in the ways that have been discussed could also help the enterprise of teacher education. As noted, the struggles children had discerning aggregates, reasoning about the mode, and working productively with context surprised the prospective teachers with whom I worked each year. Helping prospective teachers anticipate children\u2019s thinking patterns is an essential part of teacher education (Jacobs and Spangler Citation 2017). The ability to anticipate can help teachers design lesson plans that are responsive to students\u2019 needs (Matthews, Hlas, and Finken Citation 2009) and guide classroom discourse in productive directions (Stein et al. Citation 2008). Surprising student thinking patterns become less surprising the more visible they are in the standards documents teachers are charged with implementing. So, revisions to the CCSSM that better reflect and develop common patterns of children\u2019s statistical thinking can help students and teachers alike.\n\nEven if the recommendations in this critique are not incorporated in future versions of the CCSSM, teachers, curriculum developers, and researchers can look for opportunities to help students develop the essential thinking processes described herein. Many of these opportunities occur in Grades 4\u20135 as students construct CCSSM-prescribed graphs. As they do so, we can look for opportunities to question children in ways that help them see the aggregate and its specific features, such as central cluster. We can also ask them to justify their conclusions about the data in reference to the data generation context, challenging assumptions that are based solely on personal beliefs. In the process, students gain opportunities to develop essential statistical thinking processes over a longer period of time, making the ambitious goals of the Grade 6 CCSSM more attainable.\n\n**Funding**\nAdditional information Funding This article is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants DRL-1356001 and DUE-1658968.

The roles of firm ownership and international organization of standard (ISO) certifications are also studied. Based on reliable and valid measurements of IT applications maturity, management institutional capability, and process management capability, the authors collect corresponding data from 123 companies in China. They find a positive relationship between capabilities and ITAM. Management institutional capability has a stronger relationship with ITAM in Chinese state-owned enterprises or public companies; while multinational companies or joint ventures witness a stronger relationship with process management capability. ISO helps companies with low management institutional capability to improve ITAM. However, for companies with higher management institutional capability, ISO mitigates the relationship and poses a shift of the importance to process management capability in improving ITAM.\n",

        "abstract": "The originalGuidelines for Biosafety in Teaching Laboratorieswere developed in 2012 in response to an outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that originated from clinical and teaching microbiology laboratories. In the 7 years since the publication of the guidelines, there have been two subsequent CDC-reportedSalmonellaoutbreaks originating from clinical and teaching microbiology laboratories. Use of and issues with the guidelines by ASM members have been tracked by various means since publication, and in 2018 it became apparent that an update of the guidelines was necessary. The Education Board of the American Society for Microbiology charged this task force with updating the guidelines based on the accumulated information. While the guidelines should look familiar, users will find that the originally separate BSL1 and BSL2 guidelines have been rolled into one document, to help eliminate redundancy and confusion. In addition, sections on risk assessment and service animals in the teaching laboratory have been added. These updated guidelines should help clarify many of the issues for which users expressed problems with the original guidelines.\n",

        "abstract": "It is important for teacher preparation programs to develop 21st century skills, suggested by the Common Core State Standards as necessary for student success, with the pre-service teachers who will be expected to incorporate these skills into their pedagogy. This chapter traces the critical thinking tools practiced in two different pre-service teacher education courses. A commonality between the courses was the use of particular young adult literature novels to explore critical thinking with pre-service teachers. The authors first identify and explicate six critical ways of thinking and learning employed with pre-service teachers. Second, the authors frame critical thinking through the use of multiple narratives with pre-service teachers. All of the critical thinking tools described in the chapter are supported with examples and provide valuable suggestions for teacher preparation programs.\n",

        "abstract": "The food-burying behavior has been reported in many mammals and birds, but was rarely observed in invertebrates. The red imported fire ants,Solenopsis invictaBuren, is an invasive pest in many areas of the world that usually performing food-burying during the foraging processes. However, the impacted factors and measureable patterns of this behavior is largely unknown. In the present study, food-burying vs food-transport behaviors ofSolenopsis invictawere observed under laboratory and field conditions. When starved (no food was provided for 37 days) in the laboratory, food (sausage) was consumed by large numbers of ants, and few burying behaviors were observed. However, when food was provided until satiation of the colonies, food-transport was suppressed and significantly more soil particles were relocated on the food and graph paper square (where the food was placed) when compared with these colonies exposed to starved conditions. Videotapes showed that soil particles (1.47 \u00b1 0.09 mm2) were preferentially placed adjacent to (in contact with) the food items at the beginning; and after the edges were covered, ants transported significantly smaller soil particles (1.13 \u00b1 0.06 mm2) to cover the food. Meanwhile, larger particles (1.96 \u00b1 0.08 mm2) were pulled/dragged around (but not in contact with) the food. Interestingly, only a small number of ants, mainly the small workers, were involved in food-burying, and the ants tended to repeatedly transport soil particles. A total of 12 patterns of particle transport were identified, and soil particles were most frequently picked from the foraging arena and subsequently placed adjacent to the food. In the field, almost all released food was actively transported bySolenopsis invictaworkers, and no burying behavior was observed. Our results show that the food-burying behavior ofSolenopsis invictamay be associated with the suppressed foraging activity, and the burying task may be carried out by certain groups of workers.\n",

The results in this research present an effective and manageable method to introduce the case analysis process and to facilitate written case analysis for both students and faculty. Experiment 1 compares the effectiveness of a semistructured one-page written case analysis over a traditional case analysis and finds the shorter assignment results in shorter grading time and better student grades. A two-case method introducing the case analysis process is tested in Experiment 2 and finds that a short lecture introducing the case analysis method and an initial small group practice case further improves student grades. Theoretical reasoning and directions for future research are discussed.\n",

Providing projects and activities that closely resemble real-world situations would likely increase the amount of knowledge and skills that students are able to transfer from school into the workforce. In this article, 7 successful professional entrepreneurs and 32 students enrolled in entrepreneurial classes were interviewed and asked to describe the problems that they encountered when working on projects. Fifteen different types of problems were classified based on the interviews. Entrepreneurs did not encounter three types of problems that students struggled with. Students encountered all but three of the same types of problems as entrepreneurs; but within these types of problems, there were some qualitative differences between the two groups. Implications and suggestions for improving courses and activities in entrepreneurship education are discussed.\n",

It is based on decoupling correlated stock price process and volatility process so that corresponding partial differential operator does not contain the mixed partial derivative term. Hence, the proposed method is numerically simple and fast. Numerical results are presented to examine the accuracy of the proposed method and to compare it with the others.\n\nKEYWORDS: Options valuation, finite volume method, alternating direction implicit method, Heston model\n\n2010 MATHEMATICS SUBJECT CLASSIFICATIONS: 65M08, 91G20, 91G60\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the reviewers for their constructive comments that significantly improve the paper.\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\n",

        "abstract": "Some studies have found that dispersal rates and distances increase with density, indicating that density\u2010dependent dispersal likely affects spatial genetic structure. In an 11\u2010year mark\u2013recapture study on a passerine, the dark\u2010eyed junco, we tested whether density affected dispersal distance and/or fine\u2010scale spatial genetic structure. Contrary to expectations, we found no effect of predispersal density on dispersal distance or the proportion of locally produced juveniles returning to the population from which they hatched. However, even though density did not affect dispersal distance or natal return rates, we found that density still did affect spatial genetic structure. We found significant positive spatial genetic structure at low densities of (postdispersal) adults but not at high densities. In years with high postdispersal (adult) densities that also had high predispersal (juvenile) densities in the previous year, we found negative spatial genetic structure, indicating high levels of dispersal. We found that density also affected fitness of recruits, and fitness of immigrants, potentially linking these population parameters with the spatial genetic structure detected. Immigrants and recruits rarely nested in low postdispersal density years. In contrast, in years with high postdispersal density, recruits were common and immigrants had equal success to local birds, so novel genotypes diluted the gene pool and effectively eliminated positive spatial genetic structure. In relation to fine\u2010scale spatial genetic structure, fitness of immigrants and new recruits is poorly understood compared to dispersal movements, but we conclude that it can have implications for the spatial distribution of genotypes in populations.\n",

        "abstract": "With limited groundwater reserves and few reservoirs, Caribbean islands such as Puerto Rico are largely dependent on regular rainfall to meet societal and ecological water needs. Thus, the ability to anticipate seasonal rainfall shortages, such as the 2015 drought, is particularly important, yet few reliable tools exist for this purpose. Consequently, interpolated surface precipitation observations from the Daymet archive are summarized on daily, annual, and seasonal time scales and compared to the host thermodynamic environment as characterized by the G\u00e1lvez\u2013Davison index (GDI), a convective potential parameter designed specifically for the tropics. Complementing the Daymet precipitation totals, \u22651.1 million WSR-88D volume scans between 2002 and 2016 were analyzed for echo tops \u2265 10 000 ft (~3 km) to establish a radar-inferred precipitation activity database for Puerto Rico. The 15-yr record reveals that the GDI outperforms several midlatitude-centric thermodynamic indices, explaining roughly 25% of daily 3-km echo top (ET) activity during each of Puerto Rico\u2019s primary seasons. In contrast, neither mean-layer CAPE, the K index, nor total totals explain more than 11% during any season. When aggregated to the seasonal level, the GDI strongly relates to 3-km ET (R2 = 0.65) and Daymet precipitation totals (R2 = 0.82) during the early rainfall season (ERS; April\u2013July), with correlations weaker outside of this period. The 4-month ERS explains 51% (41%) of the variability to Puerto Rico\u2019s annual rainfall during exceptionally wet (dry) years. These findings are valuable for climate downscaling studies predicting Puerto Rico\u2019s hydroclimate in future atmospheric states, and they could potentially be adapted for operational seasonal precipitation forecasting.\n",

        "abstract": "Past research has demonstrated that consumers' price fairness judgments are influenced by comparisons between the offer price they receive and the prices paid by other consumers for the same product offering. In today's digital age, reference points for purchases are more prevalent than ever. However, investigations on how certain inputs of the transaction affect these judgments is lacking. Specifically, extant research has failed to account for how the purchase efforts of other consumers can influence one's own price fairness evaluations. Moreover, relatively little empirical research has endeavored to understand the simultaneous cognitive and affective processes that explain how consumers arrive at price fairness judgments. To address these gaps in the literature, we introduce two studies aimed at understanding the process through which the salient efforts of referent consumers serve to mitigate perceptions of price unfairness when two customers pay different prices for the same product. The findings support a dual\u2010process model whereby the efforts of other (referent) customers serve to simultaneously reduce buyer anger and increase buyer understanding of the price disparity, ultimately mitigating perceptions of price unfairness.\n",

        "abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is estimated to affect 50% of diabetic patients. Although DPN is highly prevalent, molecular mechanisms remain unknown and treatment is limited to pain relief and glycemic control. We provide a novel model of acute DPN in zebrafish ( Danio rerio) larvae. Beginning 5 days postfertilization (dpf), zebrafish expressing nitroreductase in their pancreatic \u03b2-cells were treated with metronidazole (MTZ) for 48 h and checked for \u03b2-cell ablation 7 dpf. In experimental design, this was meant to serve as proof of concept that \u03b2-cell ablation and hyperglycemia are possible at this time point, but we were surprised to find changes in both sensory and motor nerve components. Compared with controls, neurod+sensory neurons were often observed outside the dorsal root ganglia in MTZ-treated fish. Fewer motor nerves were properly ensheathed by nkx2.2a+perineurial cells, and tight junctions were disrupted along the motor nerve in MTZ-treated fish compared with controls. Not surprisingly, the motor axons of the MTZ-treated group were defasciculated compared with the control group, myelination was attenuated, and there was a subtle difference in Schwann cell number between the MTZ-treated and control group. All structural changes occurred in the absence of behavioral changes in the larvae at this time point, suggesting that peripheral nerves are influenced by acute hyperglycemia before becoming symptomatic. Moving forward, this novel animal model of DPN will allow us to access the molecular mechanisms associated with the acute changes in the hyperglycemic peripheral nervous system, which may help direct therapeutic approaches.\n",

        "abstract": "Hookworms are infectious parasites that affect more than 500 million people worldwide, causing extensive morbidity and economic burden in developing countries. Mass drug administration is a current control method, but resistance is of concern. Many hookworm species, including those in the genusAncylostoma, are specialists and require specific host signals to continue development upon infection. Little is known about the signaling mechanisms, although evolutionary conservation between parasitic nematodes and the model organismC. eleganssuggests that G\u2010protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed in amphid neurons are chemosensory detection candidates. The amphid neurons ofC. elegansare exposed to the environment, even during the dauer stage, an alternate phase of larval development that is similar to the parasitic infective juvenile stage. Previous experiments involvingA. ceylanicumtranscriptional GFP fusions inC. elegansidentified putative GPCR genes expressed in neurons during dauer stage. To confirm that hookworm proteins are neuronally localized under dauer conditions, a translational GFP fusion of a putative hookworm GPCR was generated. The entire coding sequence, plus introns, was cloned using homologous recombination\u2010based, yeast assembly methods to create a C\u2010terminal GFP fusion. The putativeA. ceylanicumpromoter consisted of the upstream intergenic region, which is approximately 5000 base pairs, and the transcriptional terminator fromC. elegans unc\u201054was used. To generate the expression plasmid, amplicons containing homology to the adjacent segment in the assembly were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and transformed into yeast. The plasmid was verified by junction\u2010confirming PCR analysis, restriction enzyme mapping, and sequencing. After microinjection, GFP expression in amphid neurons of stably transformedC. elegansduring the dauer stage would support the hypothesis that this putative GPCR plays a role in reception of host signaling molecules and may provide a possible therapeutic target.\n\nSupport or Funding Information\n\nThis work was supported by the Salisbury University Faculty Mini\u2010Grant Program.\n\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2019 Meeting.

        "abstract": "A naturally\u2010occurring element, inorganic arsenic is found around the world in soil. It can contaminate fresh groundwater, where it is at risk of being ingested. Currently, arsenic is considered to be dangerous with chronic exposure and ingestion at 10 ug/L as established by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Chronic exposure to arsenic is associated with inflammation, but current studies have show that even at lower doses, there is a link to expression and secretion changes of cytokines within T lymphocytes, particularly with IL\u20102 for growth, pro\u2010inflammatory IFN\u2010\u03b3 and anti\u2010inflammatory IL\u20104. Shifts favoring pro\u2010 or anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines can lead to differentiation into TH1 or TH2 cells, which specialize in their immune response. In this study, we aim to investigate how the expression and secretion of these cytokines produced by activated T lymphocytes change as an in\u2010vitro model of an activated human regulatory immune system. Through our model, we will detect if chronic low level arsenic exposure has the potential to catalyze a change in T lymphocyte function, and therefore overall immune function.\n\nPrevious studies have utilized various conditions by which to activate and treat T lymphocytes. As a result, there is variation in how these cytokines are predicted to change. For this study, we obtained human T lymphocytes. They were treated over 24 hours with 10 ng/mL of phytohemagglutinin, a known immune activator, and different concentrations of arsenic to develop a dose response curve, from 20 nM to 500 nM. Viable concentration and cytolethality were determined with differential staining and counting. Cell concentration and cytolethality changes were examined with one\u2010way ANOVA and Bonferroni's Pairwise T\u2010test. At 50 nM there is a difference in the cytolethality of the cells in the groups treated with arsenic with or without PHA with p < 0.05.\n\nFuture work will include ELISA assays will be performed on all treatment groups of the cell media collected for IL\u20102, IL\u20104, and IFN\u2010\u03b3, followed by gene expression analysis via PCR. Experiments at 50 nM will be repeated as well to verify differences in cytolethality that were identified. Additionally, differential time periods for treatments of arsenic and PHA will be used to more accurately model chronic exposure in the cells. These other time points will analyzed through ELISA and gene expression analyses to inform the model of long\u2010term change within the cells of the cytokine profiles.\n\nSupport or Funding Information\n\nThis research is supported by the Salisbury University Department of Biological Sciences, the Salisbury University Honors College, and the Salisbury University Henson School of Science Grant.\n\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2019 Meeting.

        "abstract": "L\u2010Ascorbate (Vitamin C) is present in the environment in plant tissues, typically at concentrations from 1\u201310mM, and as high as 300mM. L\u2010Ascorbate is also an essential radical scavenger (antioxidant) for plants and mammals and is not synthesized by bacteria. Given the ubiquity of L\u2010ascorbate in the environment, metabolism of L\u2010ascorbate necessarily contributes to ecological recycling.Ralstonia eutrophaH16, a soil bacterium commonly studied for its versatile use of organic and inorganic carbon sources, can use L\u2010ascorbate as a carbon source via an unknown pathway. Using RNAseq, whole cell transcript levels inR. eutrophawere compared between L\u2010ascorbate\u2010grown cells and succinate\u2010or fructose\u2010grown cells (controls). Putative pathway genes were identified by their increase in expression greater than 50\u2010fold inR. eutrophagrown with L\u2010ascorbate. Mutant strains (lacking putative pathway genes) were generated by homologous recombination directed allelic exchange. Wild type and mutant strains were grown in liquid cultures with either L\u2010ascorbate or succinate as their sole carbon source and monitored by optical density to observe the phenotypic result of gene deletion. Growth studies have been performed, and L\u2010ascorbate no growth phenotype has been confirmed for three mutant strains. Collaborators have characterized putative pathway enzymes. Characterizing the proposed catabolic pathway of L\u2010ascorbate inR. eutrophawill provide information regarding environmental nutrient cycling and contribute novel functions of suspected pathway enzymes to protein databases.\n\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2019 Meeting.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper explores how two teacher candidates in an equity-focused preparation program negotiated among multiple perspectives about teaching the English Language Arts in linguistically and culturally diverse teaching contexts. We present cases of two preservice teachers (PTs) who experienced tensions in their development as a result of ideological coherence within program coursework. One PT experienced tensions in fieldwork with colleagues who thought differently about English teaching, and another PT experienced tensions within coursework as he struggled to find space to engage in his own inquiries beyond the required curriculum. This paper contributes to research about how teacher education can support PTs\u2019 ability to negotiate complex and sometimes conflicting demands of multiple communities they work in as educators. KEYWORDS: Critical literacy, preservice teachers, field experiences, English education. Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors. Notes 1. Here, and elsewhere we use the term culturally diverse to reference various aspects of identity, including but not limited to race and ethnicity. We understand sociocultural factors that influenced teaching and learning in Sara and George\u2019s contexts were students\u2019 countries of origin or self-identified ethnic heritage, their family\u2019s citizenship status, and following Paris and Alim\u2019s (Citation2014) call for culturally sustaining pedagogy, aspects of youth culture such as participation in music communities or gaming affinity groups. We understand culture to be plural and comprised of both artifacts and practices (Guti\u00e9rrez & Rogoff, Citation2003). For example, one individual might participate in various cultural groups and identify with multiple cultural identities. 2. Sara, George, and other participants in Cohort 1 noted the misalignment of an out-of-department class about special education and assessment that did not adequately address equity and sociocultural learning. This course was eliminated from the course sequence after Cohort 2 completed their program. Paris, D., & Alim, H. S. (2014). What are we seeking to sustain through culturally sustaining pedagogy?

        "abstract": "L\u2010Ascorbate is an antioxidant produced by many eukaryotes and is available for microbial organisms in eukaryotic detritus.Ralstonia eutrophaH16, a soil bacterium that is studied due to its extensive metabolism and bioplastic producing capabilities, can use L\u2010ascorbate via a metabolic pathway that is different from the known pathways ofEscherichia coliand plants. Transcript levels were measured in L\u2010ascorbate\u2010grownRalstonia eutrophaH16 and compared to transcript levels of succinate\u2010 and fructose\u2010grownRalstonia eutrophaH16. Genes with a larger than 50\u2010fold upregulation during L\u2010ascorbate growth were investigated. A BLAST search suggested that the proteins encoded by the genes of interest inRalstonia eutrophaH16 differ from enzymes of theEscherichia coliL\u2010ascorbate metabolic pathway. Ralstonia eutrophaH16 does not convert L\u2010ascorbate into L\u2010threonate and oxalate, as plants do. Genes of interest,h16_rs15015andh16_rs19815, were deleted. The resultant mutants do not grow with L\u2010ascorbate. The deletion of specific metabolic genes allows us to better understand their function and importance to the cell's metabolism, furthering our understanding of how different enzymatic metabolic pathways function in nature.\n\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2019 Meeting.

        "abstract": "Mesophotic reef corals remain largely unexplored in terms of the genetic adaptations and physiological mechanisms to acquire, allocate, and use energy for survival and reproduction. In the Hawaiian Archipelago, theLeptoserisspecies complex form the most spatially extensive mesophotic coral ecosystem known and provide habitat for a unique community. To study how the ecophysiology ofLeptoserisspecies relates to symbiont\u2013host specialization and understand the mechanisms responsible for coral energy acquisition in extreme low light environments, we examinedSymbiodinium(endosymbiotic dinoflagellate) photobiological characteristics and the lipids and isotopic signatures fromSymbiodiniumand coral hosts over a depth\u2010dependent light gradient (55\u20137\u03bcmol\u2009photons\u2009m\u22122s\u22121, 60\u2013132\u2009m). Clear performance differences demonstrate different photoadaptation and photoacclimatization across this genus. Our results also show that flexibility in photoacclimatization depends primarily onSymbiodiniumtype. Colonies harboringSymbiodiniumsp.COI\u20102showed significant increases in photosynthetic pigment content with increasing depth, whereas colonies harboringSymbiodiniumspp.COI\u20101andCOI\u20103showed variability in pigment composition, yield measurements for photosystem II, as well as size and density ofSymbiodiniumcells. Despite remarkable differences in photosynthetic adaptive strategies, there were no significant differences among lipids ofLeptoserisspecies with depth. Finally, isotopic signatures of both host andSymbiodiniumchanged with depth, indicating that coral colonies acquired energy from different sources depending on depth. This study highlights the complexity in physiological adaptations within this symbiosis and the different strategies used by closely related mesophotic species to diversify energy acquisition and to successfully establish and compete in extreme light\u2010limited environments.\n",

        "abstract": "Aquilaria sinensis (Lour.) Gilg is an economically important tree species that produce the highly prized agarwood. In recent years, agarwood production has been seriously threatened by the outbreak of Heortia vitessoides Moore, a leaf-eating pest that shows gregariousness during the larval stage. However, little attention has been paid to the aggregation behavior of H. vitessoides larvae. In the present study, we collected 102 cohorts of H. vitessoides larvae (13,173 individuals in total) in the wild; 54 cohorts were comprised of the same-instar larvae, and 48 cohorts were comprised of larvae with different developmental stages (instars). In general, young larvae (<third instar) tended to form large aggregations, whereas older-instar larvae were either solitary or formed small aggregations. Laboratory studies showed a strong aggregation tendency in the newly hatched and second-instar larvae of H. vitessoides, whenever the individuals originated from the same or different sibling cohorts. In addition, all newly hatched larvae died within two days after they were isolated. When newly hatched larvae were initially assigned in 10-larvae cohorts (containing sibling individuals) or 20-larvae cohorts (either containing individuals originating from the same or different sibling cohorts), their larval survivorship, duration of larval stage, and adult emergence were not significantly different. Interestingly, combining avermectin-treated larvae (donors) with untreated ones (receptors) significantly decreased larval survivorship and adult emergence of receptors, indicating a horizontal transfer of avermectin among H. vitessoides larvae. This study enhances our understanding of the population ecology of H. vitessoides, and may bring novel insights into the management strategies against this pest.\n",

Original surveys, interviews, and a document review provided four major themes. Above all, MACS member schools prioritize the mission and draw leadership applicants from an almost entirely monochromatic applicant pool. Most MACS school leaders claimed an acceptance of colorblindness yet saw the need to develop cultural awareness. To reach their utmost potential, MACS member schools would benefit from diversification of leadership.\n\nAdditional information\nNotes on contributors\nBrian Mark Zockoll\nBrian M. Zockoll Jr., EdD works as an English and Education professor in both Christian and secular universities. He is also active in the Maryland Association of Christian Schools as well as his local church. His wife Andrea and he enjoy travelling and will welcome their first child this fall.\n",

Undergraduate women ( n = 1,005) completed the Body-Esteem Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Sexual Experiences Survey. Women raped within the past year (recently) reported lower levels of both body-esteem and self-esteem than those raped over a year ago (earlier) and nonvictims, but women raped earlier did not differ from nonvictims. Rape labeling status was not significant. Findings identify lower body-esteem, in addition to lower self-esteem, as correlates of recent rape.\n",

The assessment of the erosion and deposition balance is therefore crucial to find out the best restoration strategies. This work presents the first results of an integrated approach for monitoring channels\u2019 morphodynamics over a six-year time frame in a low energy restored salt marsh at Poplar Island (Maryland, USA). The combined use of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and traditional GPS cross sections surveys was adopted to detect the current shape of the channels. Due to the site extent of 400 m by 400 m, three missions were performed flying at a 40 m altitude. The comparison with the initial as-built survey showed the effects of erosion and deposition phenomena. The technique provided reliable results at low cost, allowing an accurate assessment of the morphodynamics over time, thanks to both high spatial resolution and the precise imageries georeferencing.\n",

Accreditation, credentialing, and licensure contribute to health practice prosperity. Kinesiology-related domain programs (exercise science, exercise physiology etc.) have incomplete achievement in program accreditation, credentialing, and licensure.\nPURPOSE: To assess Program Directors\u2019 perspectives on CoAES-mediated CAAHEP accreditation for the Exercise Sciences.\nMETHODS: A 19-question survey was developed and validated by an expert committee. Upon IRB approval, an exploratory study was conducted. Results were anticipated to offer data clarifying the Program Directors\u2019 perspectives, and enabling CoAES insight to forward a more positive accreditation path. Electronically solicited, 75 individuals from approximately 500 commercially identified Kinesiology-related programs (undergraduate and graduate) with published e-mail addresses, offered responses. Utilizing descriptive statistics, response analyses were performed in context of survey items.\nRESULTS: The following data graphs represent salient features of survey results:\nCONCLUSION: Respondents indicated several major barriers; one of which being 40% of faculty had never discussed pursuing accreditation. The CoAES is challenged to disseminate accreditation information to promote accreditation discussions, and mitigate barriers perceptions. Data support CoAES\u2019 Accreditation Ambassador/Mentor Program, which addresses noted needs. Copyright \u00a9 2019 by the American College of Sports Medicine View full article text\n",

        "abstract": "Enthalpy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics\n\nThe change in enthalpy of a chemical reaction conducted at constant pressure is equal to the heat of the reaction plus the nonexpansion work of the reaction, \u0394H = qP + wadditional. After deriving that relationship, most general and physical chemistry textbooks set wadditional = 0 to arrive at the claim that \u0394H = qP, and nearly all further discussion of enthalpy assumes that \u0394H = qP. Setting wadditional = 0 is viable for spontaneous reactions, but for nonspontaneous reactions, wadditional \u2260 0 as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. Therefore, \u0394H \u2260 qP for nonspontaneous reactions. Moreover, nonexpansion work is important for many interesting and important spontaneous reactions in biology (e.g., muscular movement, nerve signal transmission) and in modern society (e.g., batteries); incorporating wadditional into \u0394H allows for a more accurate discussion of the energy flow in these reactions. In this paper, I show that \u0394H \u2260 qP for nonspontaneous reactions, and I discuss how \u0394H must be partitioned between qP and wadditional for several kinds of reactions according to the second law of thermodynamics. Finally, I suggest how the discussion of enthalpy could be corrected in general and physical chemistry textbooks.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\n\nObjective: To examine unique relations of three distinct dimensions of desirability of control with psychological and physical well-being and coping. \n\nDesign: Study 1 (n = 122) surveyed undergraduates\u2019 response to everyday stressors, and Study 2 (n = 105) examined undergraduates\u2019 adjustment to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks at 1 and 3 months post-attack. \n\nMain outcome measures included psychological distress, perceived stress, rumination, health behaviors, alcohol use and active vs. avoidant coping. \n\nStudy 1 Results: Self- and other-control were associated with active coping, whereas relinquishing control was linked with avoidant coping. Only relinquishing control was uniquely linked with outcomes, including worse psychological and physical well-being and alcohol use; avoidant coping mediated relations to psychological well-being. \n\nStudy 2 Results: Again, self-control was associated with active coping whereas relinquishing control was linked with avoidant coping. Self-control was associated with enhanced psychological well-being at T1 and increases in well-being over time; by contrast, relinquishing control was associated with worse T1 psychological well-being, which was mediated by avoidant coping. \n\nConclusion: This is the first study to examine the unique contribution of each DOC dimension with outcomes. Self-control and relinquishing control showed divergent relations to psychological well-being, mediated by different coping pathways.\n\nKeywords: Desirability of control, self-control, psychological well-being, coping, alcohol\n\nAcknowledgments: We are grateful to Rachel Steele for comments on a draft of this article, and to Bernadette Boula, Amanda Caringi, Jessica Carnrike, Amy Corneau, Melissa Dillon and Christopher Manfred for assistance with data collection.\n\nDisclosure statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n",

        "abstract": "This paper explores top-down, enacted, institutional pushbacks to supermobility and superdiversity in the under-examined arena of academia using emerging frameworks in political economy and the geography of mobility. Zooming in on the discoursal framings of a recent year of job advertisements on a popular, open-source forum for linguists supplemented with qualitatively and quantitatively sourced data from international, national, and local institutional contexts, the paper examines how macrocontextual pushes toward political populism combined with a synchronous tightening of job markets in academia have enacted a plethora of labels for temporary work in lieu of permanent academic positions\u2014now, increasingly the only option for job seekers in a hypercompetitive academic market. In this manufacturing of euphemization discourse, we witness the invention of novel, microlinguistically rendered lexicalizations of semiotic redundancy in academic capitalism\u2019s own obfuscation of profit margins, and a concomitant manufacturing of a new discourse of rationality in which floating semiotic signifiers at multiple scales deploy nationality-criteria to justify ethnic exclusion and/or entry into academic space. More crucially, in these commonsensical framings, we encounter both causation and consequence of newly enacted barriers to transnational mobility. In challenging the myth of porous borders for mobile professionals in the post-global moment, these emerging linguistic signifiers point to the ascendancy of a new public affectivity on display in intellectual spheres and a saturation of sentiment toward illiberality.\n",

        "abstract": "This review focuses on the disclosure decisions faced by employees with concealable stigmatized identities\u2014one of the most challenging decisions these individuals must make on a day\u2010to\u2010day basis. Indeed, multiple theoretical frameworks have provided a foundation for understanding the antecedents and outcomes associated with the decision to disclose or not to disclose a stigmatized identity. What is less clear, however, is the extent to which these frameworks have been empirically supported. This systematic review serves to unify the extant literature and prompt continued research related to employees with concealable stigmatized identities. Specifically, we draw upon multiple fields of study, including applied psychology, management, social psychology, and occupational health as a means to systematically synthesize the existing empirical research related to disclosure of stigmatized identities at work. In addition to advancing the scholarly knowledge of disclosure, this review also provides practical utility to organizations as they continue to create work environments that foster inclusion of all stigmatized and nonstigmatized employees.\n",

        "abstract": "Although algebra often functions as a gatekeeper to higher-level mathematics courses and higher education admissions, few quality measures exist for assessing conceptual understanding. This study explored the technical adequacy of three procedural and two conceptual algebra screening measures. We administered three rounds of assessments throughout an algebra course to 2,021 secondary students of 31 teachers in three states. Assessments included procedural and conceptual screening measures and additional criterion measures: teacher ratings of students\u2019 algebra proficiency, course grades, results of two project-specific algebra proficiency exams, and state test scores. Descriptive and correlation analyses were used to investigate measure scores, alternate-form and test\u2013retest reliability, concurrent validity, and predictive validity. Procedural measure results indicated high levels of reliability ( r = .72\u2013.99), and moderate concurrent and predictive validity ( r = .36\u2013.64; .36\u2013.58). The conceptual measures produced moderate to low levels of validity ( r = .10\u2013.44). The procedural measure results suggest they may be suitable for use as screening measures, pending further revision and diagnostic testing, while the conceptual measures did not produce acceptable results for current implementation. The findings contributed to measure redesigns to bolster their use as mathematics proficiency assessments with algebra students.\n",

        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus-induced hyperglycemia is associated with a number of pathologies such as retinopathy, nephropathy, delayed wound healing, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Approximately 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus will develop DPN, which is characterized by disrupted sensory and/or motor functioning, with treatment limited to pain management. Zebrafish ( Danio rerio) are an emerging animal model used to study a number of metabolic disorders, including diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and delayed wound healing have all been demonstrated in zebrafish. Recently, our laboratory has demonstrated that following the ablation of the insulin-producing \u03b2-cells of the pancreas (and subsequent hyperglycemia), the peripheral nerves begin to show signs of dysregulation. In this study, we take a different approach, taking advantage of the transdermal absorption abilities of zebrafish larvae to extend the period of hyperglycemia. Following 5 days of 60 mM d-glucose treatment, we observed motor axon defasciculation, disturbances in perineurial glia sheath formation, decreased myelination of motor axons, and sensory neuron mislocalization. This study extends our understanding of the structural changes of the peripheral nerve following induction of hyperglycemia and does so in an animal model capable of potential DPN drug discovery in the future.\n\nNEW & NOTEWORTHY Zebrafish are emerging as a robust model system for the study of diabetic complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and impaired wound healing. We present a novel model of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in zebrafish in which the integrity of the peripheral nerve is dysregulated following the induction of hyperglycemia. By using this model, future studies can focus on elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms currently unknown.\n",

        "abstract": "This embedded case study investigates the nature of authorship in a secondary English Language Arts classroom by examining two adolescents\u2019 writing identities and experiences writing across genres. Using rhetorical genre theory, the study illustrates how composition and notions of authorship in this context were strongly informed by conversations\u2014both with peers and the teacher. An additional finding was that students wrote themselves into different genre identities as they composed poetry, editorials, and memoirs, drawing on different authorial stances and sources of knowledge. Finally, this analysis documents robust learning about the nature of writing, including transferring rhetorical strategies across contexts and purposes, skills often called for in education policy as well as career and college writing, not documented in secondary schools. Implications for teaching include valuing relationship-building conversations, offering students multiple genre positions across secondary writing experiences, and considering ways to build upon writers\u2019 self-described and socially constructed identities as successful writers.\n",

        "abstract": "A key trend in the 210\u2010million\u2010year\u2010old history of modern turtles was the evolution of shell kinesis, that is, shell movement during neck and limb retraction. Kinesis is hypothesized to enhance predator defense in small terrestrial and semiaquatic turtles and has evolved multiple times since the early Cretaceous. This complex phenotype is nonfunctional and far from fully differentiated following embryogenesis. Instead, kinesis develops slowly in juveniles, providing a unique opportunity to illustrate the postembryonic origins of an adaptive trait. To this end, we examined ventral shell (plastral) kinesis in emydine box turtles and found that hatchling plastron shape differs from that of akinetic\u2010shelled relatives, particularly where the hinge that enables kinesis differentiates. We also demonstrated shape changes relative to plastron size in juveniles, coinciding with a shift in the carapace\u2010plastron structural connection, rearrangement of ectodermal plates, and bone repatterning. Furthermore, because the shell grows larger relative to the head, complete concealment of the head and extremities is only achieved after relative shell proportions increase. Structural alterations that facilitate the box turtle's transformation are probably prepatterned in embryos but require function\u2010induced changes to differentiate in juveniles. This mode of delayed trait differentiation is essential to phenotypic diversification in turtles and perhaps other tetrapods.\n",

        "abstract": "This article draws from an ongoing longitudinal qualitative inquiry into the preparation and development of social justice\u2013oriented urban English teachers. It examines the cases of three graduates of an urban education\u2013focused teacher preparation program who claim different intersectional identities and have completed their fourth year as urban educators. The article explores two research questions. First, how do these teachers understand and enact critical education practices within their curriculum and instruction, socially situated relationships, and institutional structures? Second, how do they experience and understand their sociocultural identities as contributors to their practices as critical educators and the associated outcomes? Two findings are discussed. First, the teachers felt greatest agency and success within their classrooms (in comparison to other institutional spaces) to enact social justice\u2013oriented curricula, instruction, and other educational practices, using relationship-building with students as the foundation of their work. Second, identity constructs of gender, age, and race significantly mediated the teachers\u2019 relationship-building efforts with colleagues and administrators, the teachers\u2019 feelings of agency, and their activities and outcomes related to justice-oriented change at institutional levels beyond the classroom. This study contributes a rare longitudinal example of how in-service critical educators\u2019 sociocultural identities impact their literacy pedagogies and institutional efforts to advance educational justice.\n",

Ecology and Recovery of Eastern Old-Growth Forests. Island Press, Chicago, Illinois, USA, 2018.\n\nWhen most people pick up a book about eastern old-growth forests, they want to know how many of these wild forests remain, where they are, what makes them unique, how we can preserve the few left, and how we can help some of our forests recover their original, pre-logged, condition. A 1996 book edited by Mary Byrd Davis addressed all of these questions and more. But that book is now more than twenty years old. My review will focus on the similarities and differences between the new Barton and Keeton book and the earlier Davis book. This seems appropriate since both books were published by Island Press and the newer book's cover seems to purposefully resemble Davis's book, and indeed both spines proclaim \u201cEASTERN OLD-GROWTH FORESTS\u201d in caps. Reaching for one or the other on the shelf requires a close look to tell them apart.\n\nAlthough there is a nod to biodiversity, the emphasis in this volume leans instead toward natural disturbance dynamics, threats to the forest, and silviculture. The disturbance chapter by D'Amato et al. does an excellent job at presenting the newest research in disturbance dynamics. The chapter includes discussions of wind, specific insects, pathogens, wildfires, ice storms, and drought and then ranks all the various disturbances by severity and scale. Much of this chapter, however, veers into a discussion of ecological silviculture. Most ecologists, myself included, are in favor of more sensitive forest management that mimics natural disturbances and promotes the structures found in old-growth forests: such as tip-up mounds, increased coarse woody debris, standing dead trees, and larger living trees; but the old-growth forests we study, and try to preserve, exist because they have escaped both silviculture and severe natural disturbance. By definition (pg. 2), old-growth forests contain old trees and are relatively undisturbed by people. Silviculture, no matter how sensitive, is a human-inflicted disturbance.\n\nThere is a very good biodiversity chapter by Gregory McGee, but it primarily addresses vascular plants, mosses, lichens, fungi, and small invertebrates such as mites, springtails, and spiders. In contrast, Davis's 1996 book also had chapters on vertebrate relationships with old-growth forests including salamanders, birds, carnivores, and even humans. With the exception of a few paragraphs about salamanders, the new book does not address the relationship of vertebrates with old-growth forests.\n\nThe chapter on forest\u2013stream interaction in eastern old-growth forests by Dana Warren et al. is a useful addition that was not covered in Davis's book. As Warren's team notes on page 159, \u201cstreams bordered by old-growth forests are profoundly different from those surrounded by younger forests.\u201d The importance of large dead wood in streams to fish and macroinvertebrates is discussed. Also discussed are the forest influences of stream light regimes and nutrient cycling on stream ecology. Those interested in stream restoration in wooded habitats should pay particular attention to this chapter.\n\nSimilar to the Davis book, there are chapters describing specific old-growth forest communities such as bottomland hardwood forests, pine woodlands, Southern Appalachian mountain forests, hardwood\u2013hemlock forests, and boreal forests. These chapters will be of interest to anyone who works in those particular ecosystems. The pine chapter by Robert Peet et al. is particularly well done. They have included a map and a table that organizes the remaining old-growth southeastern pine savannas into useful categories. The boreal forest chapter by Kneeshaw et al. has an interesting discussion of planning for natural disturbances by managing on a landscape scale instead of a single forest scale. But, as they remark on pages 146\u2013147, \u201csuch foresight and long-term large-scale planning is an aspirational concept that remains a long way from being made operational.\u201d\n\nMost troubling to me was the chapter on silviculture by Keeton et al. On page 238, they pose the interesting question: \u201cIs it better to let old growth recover passively or could silvicultural methods be used to restore or increase the representation of old-growth characteristics in secondary forests?\u201d Instead of presenting data to answer that question, the idea of passive recovery is waved away with a pen stroke. They write: \u201cIn the Anthropocene, the idea of just letting nature take its course no longer seems to be an adequate strategy.\u201d Without further proof, I am not convinced of this. A paragraph later they write: \u201cEven if passive management could restore healthy old-growth forests, the process in the existing second-growth would often involve a delay of another 60\u2013150 years.\u201d\n\nWhile their arguments to use active management to increase structural complexity in second-growth forests are persuasive and could lead to increased habitat types and increased biodiversity in the short term, time is integral to the development of an old-growth forest. Thinking that putting more woody debris on the forest floor, and scarifying and pushing over some trees, will create an old-growth forest is like thinking you can make a teenager an elderly person by dying their hair gray. Calling this sort of management \u201cold-growth silviculture\u201d is somewhat misleading. \u201cOld-growth-like silviculture\u201d or \u201csilviculture for old-growth characteristics\u201d would be less confusing. Also, when discussing the benefits or drawbacks of active management for creating old-growth-like characteristics in a specific forest, one should be very clear if the management is for a forest that will continue to have wood fiber taken out of it (a \u201cworking forest\u201d), or if it is a preserved forest where natural forces will be allowed to prevail. Silviculture, even as sensitive and well-intentioned as the type described here, may not be appropriate for the latter. These distinctions are not well developed here, and the emphasis seems to be toward managing for \u201cmultiple benefits\u201d with talk of rotation periods or entry times. This well-researched and well-written chapter would be an excellent addition to a silviculture book, but it felt out of place in a volume titled Ecology and Recovery of Eastern Old-Growth Forests.\n\nThe chapter on silviculture would be stronger if it also discussed the drawbacks to active management. Do we really need to mimic natural disturbance processes when they are still at work? Does the introduction of humans with chain saws (for creating snags and coarse woody debris) and heavy equipment (for tipping over trees) have any negative consequences for other forest organisms (such as herbaceous plants, snails, and turtles)? The introduction of nonnative invasive plants is a huge risk associated with any sort of active management these days. A chapter by John Gunn and David Orwig spells out the impact of this growing threat, along with all the rest of the invaders from the emerald ash borer to beech bark disease.\n\nIn the past twenty years, climate change has become an important factor in forest disturbance and in the value of carbon sequestration by old-growth forests. Discussions of climate change are to be found in many of these chapters. A very useful chapter by Keeton discusses our current understanding of carbon dynamics in forests as they age and change. Again, however, the discussion moves toward silviculture. Silviculture for old-growth characteristics is encouraged for working forests as a way to increase carbon stocking and potentially reap the financial rewards of the carbon market.\n\nThe Wildlands and Woodlands vision Foster (2017) promoted by Harvard Forest for the New England landscape calls for 10% of the forests to be treated as wildlands to protect biodiversity and wilderness. Since we are nowhere near that percentage at present, we need to have serious discussions about how we can begin to let formerly logged forests become wild once again. It would have been nice to see that discussion in this new book. As biologist Victor Scheffer (1973) says, \u201cThe wisdom, goodness, and greatness of Man will be measured not wholly by technical power over the wild things of Earth but also by his moral strength in letting them be.\u201d\n\nAlthough this book is an important reference for those studying eastern old-growth forests, it will not replace Davis's iconic 1996 volume.\n",

        "abstract": "Growth rate of Fundulus heteroclitus was examined at 25 and 30 \u00b0C in nine treatments of diel-cycling dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH. Extreme diel-cycling DO (1\u201311 mg O2\u00b7L\u22121) negatively impacted growth during 10 days at 30 \u00b0C, but not at 25 \u00b0C. Moderate DO cycles (3\u20139 mg O2\u00b7L\u22121) had no direct growth impact at either temperature. Fish did not appear to acclimate, during days 10\u201330, to the initial growth-limiting effects of extreme diel DO cycles at 30 \u00b0C. Diel-cycling DO interacts synergistically with temperature to impact growth. There was no evidence of an independent growth effect of either moderate pH cycles (7.2\u20137.8) or extreme pH cycles (6.8\u20138.1) at either temperature. Mean low pCO2levels in extreme cycles were \u223c32\u2009000 and \u223c47\u2009000 \u03bcatm at 25 and 30 \u00b0C, respectively. It is noteworthy that these high mean nightly pCO2levels are more than an order of magnitude higher than the chronic mean oceanic pCO2of \u223c1000 \u03bcatm projected by the year 2100.\n",

        "abstract": "Female bird song has been underappreciated and understudied, especially in temperate species. Birdsong was originally thought to be a trait used primarily by male songbirds for mate attraction and male/male contest. However, ornithologists have long known that females sing in many tropical songbirds, often for similar functions to male song. Yet, studies of female song in temperate regions remain scarce. Increasing our understanding of the function of female song in temperate species is a powerful step towards discerning the selective pressures that maintain elaborate female signals. In the last few decades, studies of temperate species have highlighted five major functional categories of female song. Using a modeling framework, based on all known functions of song in other species, we tested the function of female song in eastern bluebirds. The modeling framework allowed us to test the effect of multiple complex behaviors simultaneously to predict female song function. Additionally, modeling mitigated issues of multiple testing across the five different functional categories. We found that female song in eastern bluebirds is primarily used in pair communication. Specifically, females sing to strengthen and maintain long-term pair bonds. Strengthening pair-bonds may be advantageous for eastern bluebirds as pairs that remain together between nesting attempts and between years have higher reproductive success. We demonstrate a clear link between the function of female song in pair communication and the likely selective force of long-term pair bonds acting on eastern bluebird reproductive success. Additionally, our study highlights a major function of female song in a temperate species.\n",

The quantum multiplication by the first Chern class c1(Gr(k,n)) induces an endomorphism c\u03021 of the finite-dimensional vector space QH*(Gr(k,n))|q=1 specialized at q = -1. Our main result is a case that a conjecture by Galkin holds. It states that the largest real eigenvalue of c\u03021 is greater than or equal to dim Gr(k,n) + 1 with equality if and only if Gr(k,n) = Pn\u22121.

The results of an online survey with 437 randomly selected students showed that students in the mid-sized state university are more interculturally sensitive than their counterparts in two dimensions of the Intercultural Sensitivity Scale (ISS). This study also found that two environment variables and one personal character variable are positively related to the student\u2019s level of intercultural sensitivity. Practical implications and limitations of the study are discussed.\n\nKEYWORDS: Intercultural sensitivity, Intercultural Sensitivity Scale (ISS), campus diversity, interculturally-friendly class environment, college students.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank three anonymous reviewers who provided thoughtful comments on the first draft of this manuscript.\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\n\nAdditional information\nNotes on contributors\nYunying Zhang (Ph.D in Communication, Washington State University) is Associate Professor in the Department of Communication at Austin Peay State University, TN.\n\nEun-Jeong Han (Ph.D in Communication, Washington State University) is Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication at Salisbury University, MD.\n",

These participants completed three computer-driven tests from a battery of measurements that assess various components of cognitive control (CC)\u2014One Card Learning Test (attention), Two Back Card Test (working memory), and Revised Groton Learning Maze Test (inhibition/ executive function). Testing took place after a bout of sedentary activity, and two weeks later, after a bout of individualized PA (based on VO2 max).\n\nDue to the high intellect/high fit nature of the participants, there was no statistical significance with the One Card learning or Two Card Back Tests (i.e., many reached the test \u2018ceiling\u2019 on the initial attempt). After controlling for sex, age, BMI, estimated aerobic capacity, and GPA, there were significant differences between sedentary and physical activity conditions in both moves-per-second (adjusted b-coefficient = 0.132, p < 0.001) and duration (adjusted b-coefficient = \u221222,653 ms, p < 0.001) within the Revised Groton Maze Learning Test. The differences between conditions represented a medium-to-large effect. There were no moderating influences on the condition differences.\n\nThis study adds to the existent literature that suggests PA may facilitate increases in CC, dependent on the nature of the cognitive task.\n\nKEYWORDS: Exercise, kinesiology, inhibition, working memory\nDisclosure statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT With increasing global exposure, organisations have started to witness supply chain risks that they traditionally were not exposed to. This article therefore attempts to answer the research question of how environmental uncertainty within a firm\u2019s supply chain impacts firm financial performance. We further evaluate the role of supply chain risk management practices in mitigating the negative impact of such disruption events. To answer the research question, we conduct a literature review and develop the corresponding hypothesis. We test our hypothesis using both primary and secondary data. The results show that environmental uncertainty has a negative impact on firm financial performance, with entrepreneurial managerial capitalism mediating the impact. However, organisations that adopt macro and network supply chain risk management practices are able to improve managerial decision making frame, and mitigate the negative impact of environmental uncertainty on firm financial performance. The article concludes with our findings, along with managerial and practitioner implications of the research.

        "abstract": "Through a behavioral study, we investigate buyers\u2019 strategic order forecasting behavior in a multi\u2010period setting under a forecast accuracy\u2010based allocation policy, where the supplier allocates (proportionally) more inventory to the buyer with the better order forecast accuracy in case of scarce supply. We developed an interactive game that simulates a supply chain in which one supplier sells a key component to two buyers, who in turn sell to consumers. In each period, buyers share forecasts of future orders with their supplier. The participants in the game play the role of a buyer, while the supplier is automated. Our experimental findings suggest that rewarding forecast accuracy in allocating inventory can significantly improve the order forecast accuracy of the buyers and reduce their forecast inflation behavior. Interestingly, even without communication of the policy, buyers learn over time that more accurate forecasts lead to better service from their supplier and improve their order forecast accuracy.\n",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the acute effect of vigorous physical activity on executive control in eighth grade students from the U.S. Participants were eighth grade students (N = 68; 26 girls, 42 boys) recruited from one middle school located in the Mountain West region of the U.S. Two groups of participants were assigned to receive either a vigorous physical activity or a sedentary condition within a counter-balanced cross-over design using a 2-week washout. Both groups were administered Trails Making Tests A (TMT-A) and B (TMT-B) at 20- and 25-min post-treatment, respectively. Mixed design ANOVA tests with repeated measures examined differences between treatments on TMT-A and TMT-B performance and the modifying effect of sex. Students who completed the physical activity condition displayed a faster time to completion on the TMT-B compared to students who completed the sedentary condition (Mean difference = \u22126.5 s, p = 0.026, d = 0.42). There were no differences between treatment groups on TMT-A and no sex \u00d7 treatment interactions (p > 0.05). This pilot study suggests that vigorous physical activity may improve executive control in middle-school students and adds to the existent literature that continues to examine the emerging link between physical activity and cognition in school-based settings.\n",

        "abstract": "Intertidal mangrove forests are a dynamic ecosystem experiencing rapid changes in extent and habitat quality over geological history, today and into the future. Climate and sea level have drastically altered mangrove distribution since their appearance in the geological record \u223c75 million years ago (Mya), through to the Holocene. In contrast, contemporary mangrove dynamics are driven primarily by anthropogenic threats, including pollution, overextraction, and conversion to aquaculture and agriculture. Deforestation rates have declined in the past decade, but the future of mangroves is uncertain; new deforestation frontiers are opening, particularly in Southeast Asia and West Africa, despite international conservation policies and ambitious global targets for rehabilitation. In addition, geological and climatic processes such as sea-level rise that were important over geological history will continue to influence global mangrove distribution in the future. Recommendations are given to reframe mangrove conservation, with a view to improving the state of mangroves in the future.\n",

        "abstract": "With the aging of Baby Boomers, 2030 will mark the first time in U.S. history that those aged 65 and older will outnumber children. This population shift is expected to place unprecedented demands on the healthcare system in terms of both volume and complexity of care. Given these population shifts and emphasis on an interdisciplinary approach to care, a 4-credit Honors aging course was developed for Honors students in nursing and other health-related majors. Aging Reexamined, Reimagined is offered in a discussion/seminar format with limited enrollment to allow for deep reflective discourse about pertinent issues affecting older adults. Topics include physical/cognitive changes, ageism, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, sexuality, aging in place, polypharmacy, addiction, depression, caregiving, elder justice, and end-of-life care. Guest speakers share their expertise on selected issues, otherwise students alternate leading discussions on remaining topics. There are three focused reflections on assigned experiences which include conducting a videotaped interview with a retired community-based older adult, attending a support group or senior center activity, and visiting a center to view various physical/technological adaptive aids that maintain mobility and independence in the home. There is also a culminating research paper on an issue of their choice. Student evaluations are overwhelmingly positive; comments include gaining in-depth knowledge about the unique needs of this population and the importance of healthy aging with an emphasis on a positive, inter-professional approach to care. It is incumbent upon educators to better prepare students to recognize ageist attitudes, as well as address the significant impact of this \u201clongevity revolution\u201d.\n",

        "abstract": "While considerable research has targeted gait, balance and preventing falls in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), less in known about the ability to rise from the floor in this population. The aims of this study were to 1) Examine the relationship between locomotion and physical performance tests and the timed supine to stand performance measure and to 2) Identify both the time required and predominant motor patterns utilized by persons with PD to complete to floor rise transition. A cross-sectional design was utilized. Twenty community-dwelling older adults with PD (mean age 74.8+/-9.5 years; 13 men) performed a standardized floor rise test and locomotion tests in a structured task circuit. Subject demographic and anthropometric data were also collected. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and Pearson Product Moment correlations. Fifteen subjects (75%) demonstrated the crouch kneel pattern and fourteen (70%) used an all-4\u2019s strategy to rise to stand. The mean time to rise from the floor was 14.9 (+/- 7.6) seconds and slower than published norms for persons without PD. Nine subjects required the use of a chair to perform floor recovery. Supine to stand performance time was significantly correlated with the: Dynamic Gait Index (r= - 0.66; p&lt;0.002), Five Times Sit to Stand Test (r=0.78; p&lt;0.001), Timed Up and Go Test (r=0.74; p&lt;0.001), and gait velocity (r= -0.77; p&lt;0.001). Rising from the floor demonstrates concurrent validity with locomotion and physical performance tests. Floor recovery techniques can be incorporated in fall prevention initiatives in conjunction with PD symptom management.\n",

        "abstract": "The black-winged subterranean termite, Odontotermes formosanus Shiraki, is a severe pest of plantations and forests in China. This termite cultures symbiotic Termitomyces in the fungal combs, which are challenged by antagonistic microbes such as Trichoderma fungi. In a previous study we showed that O. formosanus workers made significantly fewer tunnels in sand containing commercially formulated conidia of Trichoderma viride Pers. ex Fries compared with untreated sand. Herein, we hypothesize that fungi in the genus Trichoderma exert repellent effects on O. formosanus. Different choice tests were conducted to evaluate the tunneling and aggregation behaviors of O. formosanus workers reacting to sand/soil containing the unformulated conidia of seven Trichoderma fungi (Trichoderma longibrachiatum Rifai, Trichoderma koningii Oud., Trichoderma harzianum Rifai, Trichoderma hamatum (Bon.) Bain, Trichoderma atroviride Karsten, Trichoderma spirale Indira and Kamala, and T. viride). We also investigated the colony-initiation preference of paired O. formosanus adults to soil treated with Trichoderma conidia (T. koningii or T. longibrachiatum) versus untreated soil. Tunneling-choice tests showed that sand containing conidia of nearly all Trichoderma fungi tested (except T. harzianum) significantly decreased tunneling activity in O. formosanus workers compared with untreated sand. Aggregation-choice test showed that T. koningii, T. atroviride and T. spirale repelled O. formosanus workers, whereas T. longibrachiatum and T. hamatum attracted termites. There was no significant difference in proportions of paired adults that stayed and laid eggs in the soil blocks treated with conidia of Trichoderma fungi and untreated ones. Our study showed that Trichoderma fungi generally repelled tunneling in O. formosanus, but may exert varied effects on aggregation preference by workers.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study evaluates the influence of resilience as a potential coping strategy to help reduce student departure from the accounting major. We collected data from 443 accounting majors at four geographically disbursed U.S. universities using a battery of psychometric instruments. With these data, we analyzed the relations between role stressors, psychological health, burnout, and departure intentions, and assessed the extent to which individual resilience levels served as a positive influence by enhancing health, and diminishing burnout and departure intentions. We found sources of role stress to have significant negative associations with psychological health, and significant positive associations with academic burnout (direct), and departure intentions (indirect). However, resilience counteracted those associations through its direct positive association with psychological health, and direct negative association with burnout. Resilience also had a significant indirect negative association with departure intentions through its direct associations with psychological health (positive) and burnout (negative). \n\nKEYWORDS: role stress, academic burnout, departure intentions, resilience\n\nDisclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors. \n\nNotes 1 Excessive turnover in public accounting has long been a topic of academic and practitioner interest. See, e.g. Leathers (1971), Hermanson et al. (1995), Brundage and Koziel (2010), and Chong and Monroe (2015). 2 http://www.insidepublicaccounting.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/The-2018-IPA-National-Benchmarking-Report.pdf. 3 In 1994, the number of test takers was 140,232, and by 2017, that number had dropped to 95,645 (Ng, 2019). 4 In a subsequent study, Byrne and Flood (2005) found among a sample of 129 first-year accounting students at an Irish university, that 84% expected (hoped) that their self-esteem would increase as a result of matriculating in the program. 5 Technically, Brown et al. (2013) found that accounting majors had a lower level of narcissism than other undergraduate and graduate business students, as well as a general population of college-age students. The authors citing Morrison (1997, p. 375) stated that \u2018\u2026 in adults, a reasonable amount of healthy narcissism allows the individual's perception of his needs to be balanced in relation to others\u2019. They also quoted DuBrin (2012, ii) who stated \u2018A healthy dose of narcissism can facilitate career success, because reasonable concern with the self helps a person think of achieving important goals and being admired as a leader\u2019. 6 Related to the concept of resilience are the concepts of \u2018grit\u2019 (e.g., Duckworth, 2016) and \u2018growth mindset\u2019 (Dweck, 2006). Prior research finds that accounting students with higher levels of grit have greater intensions to become professionally qualified accountants (Aziz, Ibrahim, Sidik, & Tajuddin, 2017). Meanwhile, accounting students with growth mindsets are more likely to aspire to work for a Big Four accounting firm (Liu, Robinson, & Xu, 2018) and are more capable of improving performance on exams (Ravenscroft, Waymire, & West, 2012). 7 The three items that comprise the role ambiguity scale (denoted as RA in Appendix A) are reverse-scored. 8 The MBI-GS[S] is a derivative of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), the latter instrument arguably the leading measure of burnout in organizational settings as evidenced by the 15,050 citations (as of November 2019) to the publication that described its development (Maslach, Jackson, Leiter, Schaufeli, & Schwab, 1986). 9 We also conducted an exploratory factor analysis of the 16 MBI-GS[S] items and found that they all loaded on their respective dimensions as prescribed by Maslach et al. (2016). 10 A series of analyses of variance revealed no significant differences in any of the primary study constructs by school. Thus, the data from all four schools were combined in all of the ensuing analyses. 11 These composite indicators appear in Table 2 below as RC1, RC2, RA1, RA2, RO1, RO2, Health1, Health2, and TI1, and TI2. 12 The maximum likelihood (ML) method CFA output indicated significant multivariate kurtosis with a Mardia\u2019s Coefficient of 48.27 and a normalized estimate of 23.62. Bentler (2006) notes that that normalized estimate values greater than 3 are indicative of nontrivial positive kurtosis, but cautions that modelling statistics may not be affected until the values exceed 5\u20136 or higher. We incorporated the elliptical estimation procedure to address the kurtosis issue. 13 The Wald test is not theory driven, i.e., it is a sample-specific, post-hoc procedure. Therefore, to determine if the associations identified in this investigation hold, replication with another sample is necessary. 14 Chong and Monroe (2015) state that as long as the conceptual integrity of a model is maintained, dropping non-significant parameters from a saturated structural model is an acceptable practice. 15 Hooper, Coughlan, and Mullen (2008) note that the relative/normed chi-square (\u03c72/df) minimizes the impact of sample size on the model chi-square while acknowledging that there is no consensus regarding an acceptable ratio for this statistic, with recommendations ranging from a high of 5.0 (Wheaton et al., 1977) to a low of 2.0 (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). 16 For the multi-sample analysis by GPA, we split the sample into two groups: students who reported a GPA below 3.4 (n = 205) and students who reported a GPA of 3.4 or above (n = 234). 17 Chong and Monroe (2015), quoting Kerlinger and Pedhazur (1973, p. 19) state that this technique \u2018can be used to determine whether the pattern of correlations for a set of observations is consistent with a specific theoretical formulation\u2019. 18 Our model has its roots in Fogarty et al.\u2019s (2000) Beyond the Role Stress Model which was drawn from the occupational health, applied psychology, and related literature. One important extension of the Fogarty et al. (2000) model that we made was to include psychological health as a burnout mediator, which follows the medical student burnout literature (Dahlin et al., 2011; Backovi\u0107 et al., 2012). 19 As noted in Appendix A, all three role stressors are measured on a five-point score ranging from A = strongly disagree, to E = strongly agree. 20 The relationship between hardiness and resilience can be gleaned from the authors\u2019 (p. 566) statement that \u2018hardiness has emerged as a pattern of attitudes and skills that is a pathway to resilience under stressful circumstances\u2019. 21 Within the U.S., our findings also have noteworthy implications for public universities in states with performance-based funding policies. These policies use performance metrics such as freshman retention rates (i.e., the percentage of first year students that continue into their second year) and six-year graduation rates to determine the level of funding provided to public universities (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/05/26/states-that-tie-higher-education-funding-to-performance-have-it-all-wrong-report-says). 22 While these admonitions are related to studies of the accounting work environment, they appear equally valid in academic accounting settings.\n",

        "abstract": "The frosted elfin (Callophrys irus Godart) is a globally rare butterfly that inhabits disturbance-dependent habitats often managed by prescribed fire. Natural history observations and published data are equivocal on whether frosted elfin caterpillars pupate below or above the soil surface, and some evidence suggests that pupation sites differ for caterpillars that feed on lupine (Lupinus spp.) versus wild indigo (Baptisia spp.). Pupation site has important implications for management because pupae located beneath the soil surface will likely be afforded greater protection from fire than those above the soil surface. Our study of both lupine- and indigo-feeding larvae at a single site in Worcester County, Maryland, found that pupation occurs above the soil surface in the leaf litter 92% of the time, and does not differ significantly with food plant preference. We recommend that land managers using prescribed fire as a habitat management tool for frosted elfin habitat assume some level of pupal mortality in burned areas and utilize a rotational burn schedule that maintains areas of unburned refugia in high-density elfin areas. We also recommend that managers try to establish a metapopulation structure for frosted elfin to address the possibility of natural occurring fires.\n",

        "abstract": "Inbreeding and genetic drift can decrease genetic heterozygosity, and this low heterozygosity can depress fitness, resulting in heterozygosity\u2013fitness correlations (HFCs). HFCs are typically small in magnitude, a result often attributed to power of the analyses. Animal behaviors often affect fitness and are often heritable to some degree. We hypothesized that heterozygosity influences behavior, which, in turn, potentially influences fitness. Specifically, in red\u2010backed salamanders,Plethodon cinereus, which have limited dispersal and the potential for inbreeding, we tested whether heterozygosity, as estimated from six microsatellite loci, affected home range size, juvenile growth, and survival. We found that salamanders with higher heterozygosity had larger home ranges and grew faster, which is indicative of reproductive success. However, we found no effects of heterozygosity on survival. We conclude that, because activity inP. cinereusis tightly linked to food uptake and mass gain, heterozygosity influences growth via effects on foraging behavior. Future research should investigate how the relationship between heterozygosity, behavior, and fitness may be affected or mediated by endocrine or immune systems.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT We examined the degree of convergence among self-regulated learning microanalysis, measures of metacognitive monitoring, and a self-regulated learning questionnaire during reading. Participants' reported strategy use during reading, as measured by self-regulated learning microanalysis, was significantly related to scores on a self-regulated learning questionnaire. Self-monitoring on the microanalytic protocol was significantly related to a measure of metacognitive monitoring as well as to participants' item-level confidence judgments. Participants who made strategy attributions for performance tended to have higher scores on the measure of reading comprehension. Strategic planning and strategy use during reading of the text also predicted comprehension. Implications and future directions for the study of self-regulated learning microanalysis are discussed. KEYWORDS: Metacognition, microanalysis, reading comprehension, self-regulated learning, strategies. Endnotes Notes 1. The course from which participants were sampled covers assessment and evaluation topics, including standardized testing and scores, in the third unit. The study was administered and completed prior to the third unit. 2. The Self-Regulation Strategy Inventory (SRSI; Cleary, Citation 2006) was also administered to participants. Obtained findings based on the SRSI were largely similar to those obtained based on the MSLQ, providing consistent evidence of convergence between SRL microanalysis and the SRL questionnaires. Findings are presented only for the MSLQ based on the strong correlation between the SRL self-report questionnaire measures. Cleary, T. J. (2006).

        "abstract": "Abstract\n\nMobile journalism is one of the fastest areas of growth in the modern journalism industry. Yet mobile journalists find themselves in a place of tension, between print, broadcast, and digital journalism and between traditional journalism and lifestyle journalism. Using the lens of field theory, the present study conducted an online survey of mobile journalists (N=39) from six countries representing four continents on how they conceive of their journalistic role, and how their work is perceived within the newsroom. Participants were journalists in television, print, magazine, and digital local and national newsrooms. The present study sought to understand how mobile journalists see mobile production as a part of their journalistic role, and what field theory dimensions influence mobile production in their newsrooms. While prior research has established a growing prevalence of lifestyle journalism, the present study finds that the growth of mobile journalism represents the development of lifestyle journalism norms, such as content driven by the audience, within even traditional journalism.\n\nKeywords: Field theory, lifestyle journalism, mobile, mobile journalism, role conception, technology\n",

Experiencing a \u201cgood death\u201d at the EOL is the optimal goal of palliative care. Studies show that the meaning and description of good death varies across cultures in different populations. In the United States, Chinese Americans comprise the largest Asian demographic. Aim: To describe EOL wishes, which define a good death for Chinese Americans. Method: Qualitative study using focus groups. A convenience sample of 60 Chinese Americans was recruited from a community organization in Maryland. Ten focus group discussion sessions were conducted. Results: Wishes at the EOL that defined a good death for the participants in this study included being pain-free, not being a burden to family, being with family, having a trusted physician, maintaining dignity, and prayer. Conclusion: A good death is a complex concept. What matters most to patients at the EOL differs depending on their cultural background. When caring for Chinese Americans, a comprehensive EOL care plan should include cultural considerations in addition to physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs.\n",

We first present a brief overview of Cambodian refugee women\u2019s history and cultural background to highlight their experiences of shared and gender-based trauma, as well as their process of recovery. Next, as informed by the posttraumatic growth model and evidence-based practices, we provide clinical recommendations with an emphasis on trauma-informed components and interventions influenced by feminist and narrative perspectives in facilitating the process of surviving trauma and thriving post-migration. Finally, we present a composite case illustration, highlighting cultural considerations to aid mental health providers in fostering posttraumatic growth in Cambodian refugee women. KEYWORDS: Cambodian refugee women, feminist narrative, posttraumatic growth, trauma.\n",

        "abstract": "The benefits of school-based mental health services have been supported in prior research and literature. Studies have shown that approximately one in five youths in schools today have diagnosable mental health disorders. However, research has identified that close to 70 percent of those youths do not receive the services they need. This gap in care has a significant impact on the academic, social, and emotional well-being of youths. Parent involvement is essential in bridging services. However, parents often face barriers in accessing mental health care for their child. The aim of this study was to explore parent perceptions of needs and barriers to school-based mental health services. This exploratory study included 607 parent and guardian respondents. Findings showed that parents were overwhelmingly in support of schools being involved in addressing the mental health needs of students. Anxiety, depression, and bullying were the top emotional and behavioral issues that parents recognized as the main challenge for their child. Lack of parent support, understanding that mental health issues even exist in youths, and lack of supportive school programs were identified as key factors that place youths at risk of not receiving the services they need.\n",

        "abstract": "Our understanding of how human activities impact insect communities is limited. Dung beetles, well known for the ecosystem services they provide, are faced with many conservation threats, particularly from deforestation and agriculture. Here we used 200-m transects and human-dung\u2014baited pitfall traps to examine dung beetle populations in 7 forests of Maryland's Coastal Plain. We set traps once a month, from May 2014 to April 2015, to determine species presence, abundance, range, and seasonality. We collected 6463 individuals representing 22 species; Janes Island State Park (JISP) had the highest abundance (2705 individuals) and Martinak State Park (MSP) had the highest species richness (19 species). During summer 2015, we examined the succession of dung beetles attracted to bait in JISP and MSP. We set 10 traps once a month (May\u2013August) in each site and collected beetles on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 without dung replacement. In JISP, Onthophagus hecate (Scooped Scarab) was abundant throughout each 21-d period, and accounted for 68% of all beetles collected. In MSP, most specimens were collected by day 5. Here we provide information for conservation of locally rare or uncommon species.\n",

Research has shown that shows that contain segments with both entertaining and informative content (e.g., The Daily Show) have increased students\u2019 political knowledge. This study investigated how the structure of segments could be adapted to present material in classroom lectures to promote recall of both learning events and course content. For the first two units in a three-unit child development course, students experienced segments along with traditional lecture activities. Although performance varied across measures, results indicated that segments are a useful teaching tool to promote retention of material and recall of learning events. The use of segments in other types of courses is discussed.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper outlines a new form of justice, called regenerative justice. Regenerative justice is the coupling of restorative justice with the notion of generative justice, which involves the explicit and intentional discovery and building of life meanings, as well as the consideration of the relationships that those meanings have with wrongdoing and \u2018making things right\u2019. This exploration comes about after first considering restorative justice, then providing a critique that uncovers potential blind spots in restorative practice. Logotherapeutic techniques, including: Socratic dialogue, attitude modulation, and dereflection, are used by therapists to help people discover meaning and purpose and have successfully assisted crime victims and offenders. Borrowing from these techniques and specific questioning approaches, restorative dialogue facilitators can enhance restorative practice, particularly in the phases of preparation for restorative dialogue and follow-up after restorative dialogue, by deliberately emphasizing meaning-building discussions (generative justice). Therefore, regenerative justice synthesizes the restoration of people and relationships with the generation of peaceful and healing meanings that can help stakeholders in wrongdoing make sense out of suffering and move forward with a sense of purpose. An example of this process is illustrated in a victim-offender dialogue in a crime of severe violence, where meaning-building can be particularly powerful.\n\nKeywords: Restorative justice, generative justice, regenerative justice, logotherapy, meaning, dialogue\n",

        "abstract": "Color polymorphism is common in many species, and color morph frequency is affected by differences in ecological and evolutionary pressures on each color morph. Plethodon cinereus, the Red-Backed Salamander, has two common color morphs, striped and unstriped, that vary in frequency among populations. Plethodon cinereus color morphs differ in their escape behaviors when exposed to predators and in their tail autotomization rates; this may result from differential predation. Although these previous studies indirectly implicated differential predation, we directly tested the hypothesis that color morphs differed in survival and whether one morph was depredated at a higher rate. We determined the survival of each color morph over 3 yr with the use of mark\u2013recapture data. We first compared frequencies of color morphs in juveniles and adults, and then estimated whether color morphs had different survival rates with the statistical program MARK. We found that frequency of striped salamanders was lower in adults than in juveniles, implying that fewer striped individuals survived to adulthood. In addition, color and age best explained survival probability during spring, but not fall, seasons. To test the effects of color morph on predation experimentally, we used clay models to determine the effects of avian and mammalian predators. We found more attacks on striped clay models by avian predators compared to the unstriped models, but we found no difference in attacks by mammals. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that there is differential predation in P. cinereus, with more predation on, and lower survival in, the striped morph.\n",

        "abstract": "Arterial stiffness has long been regarded as an indicator of disease and is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events. Controversies exist amongst the impact of resistance training protocols on the stiffening process in the major elastic arteries. This study was designed to address some of the controversies.\n\n## PURPOSE:\nTo determine the vascular impact of a high\u2010volume (HV), moderate resistance training program and a high\u2010intensity (HI), moderate repetition training program on arterial compliance.\n\n## METHODS:\n21 otherwise healthy, male university students with limited resistance training experience (< 6 months) were randomized into one of three groups: 7 control (CO) group (22\u00b13 yrs), 6 HI resistance exercise group (23\u00b13 yrs), and 8 HV resistance exercise group (21\u00b13 yrs). All were subjected to a series of tests including anthropometry, ultrasonography of the carotid artery, applanation tonometry, blood pressure acquisition, and maximal strength assessment. Subjects were instructed to maintain normal dietary patterns throughout the study period. Food consumption was monitored. All subjects in the training groups performed the same 8\u201310 exercises on training days. Subjects in the HV group trained at 50\u201370% of 1\u2010RM with 10\u201315 repetitions and 2\u20134 sets per exercise for 3\u20135 days a week for 12 weeks. Subjects in the HI group trained at 70\u201395% of 1\u2010RM with 3\u20136 repetitions and 2\u20133 sets per exercise for 3\u20135 days a week for 12 weeks. Subjects randomized to the control group were instructed to refrain from both cardiovascular and resistance exercise during the study period. Arterial stiffness comparisons were calculated with two\u2010way ANOVA with repeated measures.\n\n## RESULTS:\n1\u2010RM significantly increased for squat (52% vs. 25%, p<0.05), bench press (31% vs. 27%, p<0.05) and seated rows (22% vs. 13%, p<0.05) in the HV and HI groups respectively. Carotid femoral PWV did not change in the HI (7.6\u00b12 vs. 8.1\u00b12 m/s, p>0.05), HV (6.3\u00b11 vs. 6.8\u00b12 m/s, p>0.05), and CO (6.7\u00b11 vs. 6.7\u00b11 m/s, p>0.05) groups. Beta stiffness index did not change in the HI (5.9\u00b13.5 vs. 5.7\u00b12.6 U, p>0.05), HV (6.5\u00b11.9 vs. 6.5\u00b12.1 U, p>0.05), and CO (7.2\u00b14.4 vs. 6.4\u00b13.1 m/s, p>0.05) groups.\n\n## CONCLUSION:\n12 weeks of HI and HV training does not appear to augment indices for arterial stiffness in young, adult males.\n\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2018 Meeting.

        "abstract": "Trivalent inorganic arsenic, arsenite, is a natural component of the earth and is often found in drinking water in areas where the composition is high. Some studies have suggested that, especially at moderate to high exposure levels, arsenite is toxic to individuals who are chronically exposed through drinking water, characterized by an increase in inflammatory cytokine release, specifically interleukin\u20101\u03b2 (IL\u20101\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u0251 (TNF\u0251). Other epidemiological studies at low to moderate exposures did not find the same correlation with inflammation. We aim to characterize and quantify the effects of arsenite exposure to macrophages to gauge any potential inflammatory response.\n\nM1 macrophages are key players in inflammatory response and secrete IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u0251 in response to Danger Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) released by neighboring cells undergoing necrosis, in coordination with Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs), molecules associated with pathogens, such as lipopolysaccharide, or LPS. We obtained a murine macrophage cell line to study the effects of arsenic on inflammatory cytokine secretionin vitro. A dose response curve was developed including varying concentrations of arsenite with and without 50 ng/mL LPS, using the same treatments without arsenite as controls. Cytolethality was determined by differential staining and counting. Secretion of cytokines after 24 hours of exposure was quantified using ELISA. Results were statistically analyzed using Student's t\u2010test and One\u2010Way ANOVA. IL\u20101\u03b2 was not differentially secreted for any concentration of arsenite, but cytolethality and TNF\u0251 secretion were significantly increased for 200 nM arsenite with LPS as opposed to 200 nM arsenite without LPS, possibly indicating that some inflammatory augmentation occurs in the presence of both arsenite exposure and a PAMP.\n\nFuture steps include analyzing alterations in expression of genes responsible for proteins involved in the secretory pathways of these cytokines. For example, the genes involved in manufacturing the pieces of the NLRP3 inflammasome, key in production of IL\u20101\u03b2, or TNF\u0251 Converting Enzyme, involved in cleavage of the TNF\u0251 precursor, may be potential targets. Additionally, we will explore differential DNA methylation using methylation sensitive and insensitive restriction enzyme digestion to examine epigenetic control of cytokine secretion in response to arsenite. These results will be reported to appraise the immunotoxic effects of arsenic exposure.\n\nSupport or Funding Information\n\nThis research is supported by the Salisbury University Department of Biological Sciences and the Salisbury University Honors College.\n\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2018 Meeting.

Access to behavioural health services is a challenge, particularly in rural communities. School-based mental health services have been recognised as an effective means of addressing the needs of students with emotional or behavioural disorders. This qualitative focus group study explored the service needs, gaps, and barriers to mental health services. Themes related to time, space, family engagement, and education for teachers and caregivers emerged from the focus groups.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTMany industries experience a shakeout, which occurs when, after an initial increase, the number of firms drops significantly in a short period of time. A shakeout drives changes in the market structure and, thus, accompanying changes in firms\u2019 strategies. In this paper, we explore differences in firms\u2019 product strategies (i.e. product quality improvement, product line management, and product market strategy) before and after the initiation of an industry shakeout, focusing on the role of product exit. In analyzing a sample of US laser printer manufacturers and their products for the period between 1983 and 2002, we find clear differences in firms\u2019 product exit decisions before and after the initiation of a shakeout. With these findings, our study contributes to the understanding of the link between industry shakeouts and firms\u2019 product strategies.KEYWORDS: Industry shakeoutproduct strategiesUS laser printer industryDisclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.Notes on contributorsKwangWook Gang received the B.A. degree in business administration from Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea; the M.A. degree in IT business from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea; and the Ph.D. degree in strategic management from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA.

        "abstract": "Manoj Das is a leading senior writer within Indian literature, with his novels, short stories, and poems centring on village and rural life, mingling realism and everyday experiences with elements of mystery, mysticism, and the supernatural as he explores the vicissitudes and aspirations of the human condition. As he describes here, Das has been \u201cgreatly influenced\u201d by the transition and transformation of India from colonialism to postcolonialism. His writings \u2014 with dramatic suspense, magical realism, and a style that with a minimal touch can convey nuances of character, motivation, and emotion \u2014 evocatively capture some of the most distinctive aspects of Indian culture, spirituality, arts, and history. His work has been compared with other famed Indian authors, particularly those writing in English (Mulk Raj Anand, R. K. Narayan, Raja Rao). In this interview, Das reflects on his life work, including the role of translation (in an Indian context of \u201ctranscreation\u201d). Das also shares his candid views on the poetics and politics of \u201cregional language literature\u201d (RLL) and \u201cIndian writing in English\u201d (IWE), an opposition relevant to postcolonial studies in the context of the (national and international) distribution and reception of literature and the wider politics of language. Conducted in the southern Indian city of Puducherry, home to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, this interview presents the influence of philosopher and guru Sri Aurobindo on Das and his work, including Das\u2019s most recent scholarship on Sri Aurobindo. Das also discusses the influences on him by the well-known Indian writers Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Fakir Mohan Senapati, and Rabindranath Tagore. This is the first interview with Das published outside of India and in the West.\n",

Results showed that ethical errors were distinct from previously established dimensions. Ethical and relationship errors resulted in lower ratings of leader liking and willingness to follow the leader, as compared to task errors. In addition to showing how error types differentially affected leader ratings, this study provided evidence for how this relationship is transmitted. Across two mediation models, behavioral attribution mediated the relationship between leader error and leader ratings after an error occurred. Theoretical and practical contributions are discussed as well as future directions for research.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTThis study examines the extent to which male and female principal candidates use language to signal their perceived values specific to open positions in the field. We analyzed Wisconsin school-leader application data by gender, seeking to understand whether or not men and women present themselves differently through language in the initial application phase. Using an electronic linguistic analysis tool (Docuscope), we identified patterns in the writing samples from 2,061 applicants and applied critical discourse analysis to determine the role gender plays in candidates\u2019 portrayals of themselves. This mixed-methods approach revealed that language use differs significantly between male and female applicants. Notably, linguistic variables common in female candidates\u2019 writing tend to focus on elaborating ideas and using compare/contrast techniques to describe beliefs. Male applicants\u2019 language is often more formal and relies heavily on passive voice. Our findings raise questions as to whether candidates may be selected because of an unconscious preference for language patterns commonly used by females or males.\n",

        "abstract": "This study explores the factor structure of job performance and each performance dimension's relative importance in determining supervisors' overall job performance ratings. We found that the optimal factor structure of job performance includes five dimensions: task performance, organizational citizenship behaviour directed toward the organization and individuals (OCB\u2010O and OCB\u2010I, respectively), and counterproductive work behaviour directed toward the organization and individuals (CWB\u2010O and CWB\u2010I, respectively). The percent\u2010based relative weight (%RW) is the highest for task performance in determining job performance, followed by OCB and CWB. Interestingly, the %RW of non\u2010task performance dimensions directed toward the organization (OCB\u2010O and CWB\u2010O) is similar to the %RW of task performance but greater than the %RW of non\u2010task performance dimensions directed toward individuals (OCB\u2010I and CWB\u2010I).

        "abstract": "Many parasites, including hookworms of the genusAncylostoma, are specialists and require host\u2010specific signals to resume development upon infection. Although little is known about the nature of these signaling molecules, evolutionary conservation between hookworms and the model nematodeC. eleganssuggests that hookworm host\u2010signal receptors are likely to be G\u2010protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are expressed in amphid neurons. Based on bioinformatic analysis of developmental stage\u2010specific RNA\u2010Seq data fromA. caninumandA. ceylanicum, predicted hookworm GPCRs with increased expression levels during the infective larval stage 3 (iL3) were identified.\n\nApproximately 1500 bp of genomic sequence upstream of the predicted start site for the putativeA. ceylanicumGPCRs were fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence to generate promoter\u2010GFP transcriptional fusion constructs, which were microinjected intoC. elegans. Of nine hookworm promoter fusions tested, four drove differential GFP expression inC. eleganstissues, including the digestive tract, pharynx, and a neuron pair. Preliminary analysis identified the neurons as interneurons, potentially involved in locomotion responses to chemosensory input inC. elegans. The putative GPCR encoded by the neuronally expressed gene is upregulated in bothA. ceylanicumandA. caninum, suggesting that it may play a general role in hookworm development during host infection. These experiments indicate that hookworm promoters can be expressed inC. elegans, providing a surrogate system for the study of hookworm gene expression patterns.\n\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2018 Meeting.

        "abstract": "Many organizations offer profit sharing plans to motivate increased effort and goal congruence. However, an unintended consequence of such plans may be to reduce honesty in managerial reporting. We investigate two commonly observed profit sharing plans (individual and pooled) in a laboratory experiment where multiple agents with private cost information submit budget requests to an employer. Consistent with our prediction based on crowding theory, our findings suggest that honesty is reduced in the presence of an individual profit sharing plan. However, when a pooled profit sharing plan is used, the adverse effects on honesty are partially mitigated. Our results suggest that an unintended consequence of profit sharing (decreased honesty) can be mitigated through interdependency from pooled plans. The results have practical implications, given that organizations have flexibility in establishing both the size and scope of their profit sharing plans. Our study also contributes to our understanding of reporting behavior, particularly in multi\u2010agent settings.\n",

One way to address this pressing issue is through curriculum. To this end, we describe an undergraduate course that we created and teach exclusively focused on the interface of psychology and global climate change. The course is a seminar structured around three broad themes: science and impacts, adaptation, and solutions. To support others developing curriculum in this area, we explain these themes and share the course organization and structure, along with our experiences in teaching it. We provide relevant examples of activities and resources in the context of the goals and outcomes of APA\u2019s \u201cGuidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major.\u201d We discuss considerations of competence and interdisciplinarity in teaching on this issue. Finally, given the magnitude and significance of climate change, we consider experiential aspects of students in the course related to stress.\n",

        "abstract": "This article analyses Aravind Adiga\u2019s Booker prize-winning novel The White Tiger (2008) through the lens of justice: philosophical, legal, and literary. What is justice when its agent is subaltern \u2014 disprivileged by both caste and class \u2014 and delivers justice to himself? I argue that the fictional representation of class, caste, poverty, and violence can be similar to the structuring and translations of justice. By writing his novel from the perspective of a subaltern character, Adiga joins the call by Dalit critics to reconfigure modernity from the interests of the oppressed and the marginalized. In the process, there can be a rethinking of postcolonial literary criticism from within the postcolonial nation, rather than the established perspective of the postcolonial nation understanding its own colonial oppression. My essay provokes wider insights into the implications for justice and human rights as they are informed and represented by literary fiction, subaltern theory, and deconstructive theory. How can a writer conceive of and represent justice \u2014 literary justice \u2014 by working within and against philosophical and legal conceptions of justice? The philosophers and theorists I invoke include Drucilla Cornell, Jacques Derrida, Wai Chee Dimock, Emmanuel Levinas, Gayatri Chakravarty Spivak, and Robert Young.\n",

Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers (N = 17), this study examines how CAM providers use their body to characterize their work as healers. The findings suggest the provider\u2019s self-reflexive awareness of their own body\u2019s illness and faith experiences informs their understanding of the patients\u2019 experience of health and disease. The study foregrounds the intersubjective nature of the provider\u2013patient relationship as an embodied interaction in the mutual construction of therapeutic goals. Provider reflection on their own bodies to make sense of their patients\u2019 experiences emphasizes provider\u2013patient coproduction of meaning and suggests ways for including the provider\u2019s self-reflexive awareness of their own body in a patient-centered healthcare relationship in ways that benefit both the patient and the provider.\n",

        "abstract": "## Aims:\nThe study aim was to understand the patient description of the therapeutic relationship with theirCAMprovider in the context of\u00a0pain self\u2010management.\n\n## Background:\nBecause pain is a subjective state, its assessment depends on patient perception of and response to pain. For nurses to provide empathetic and compassionate care, there is a need to explicate patient perceptions of the therapeutic relationship to (re)conceptualize models of patient\u2010centred care.\n\n## Design:\nInductive qualitative content analysis of patient interviews was conducted to identify how patients described therapeutic relationship themes and understand self\u2010management of pain.\n\n## Methods:\nParticipants were individuals working with aCAMpractitioner and solicited through purposive and snowball sampling in collaboration with the practitioners from the mid\u2010Atlantic region of the United States in 2016 (N=13). Verbatim transcriptions of audio\u2010recorded semi\u2010structured in\u2010depth interviews (430 single\u2010spaced pages approximately) were content analysed.\n\n## Findings:\nPatients described the therapeutic relationship with the provider as a: (1) giver, who was \u201cin\u2010tune\u201d with their sense of self to support self\u2010affirmation through empathetic listening; and (2) guide, who connected the mind and body through their practice to support self\u2010reflective learning.\n\n## Conclusion:\nThis description of theCAMtherapeutic relationship advances understandings of readjustment of patient relationship with pain through the provider's empathetic listening and connecting the mind and the body to support patient self\u2010affirmation of pain experiences and self\u2010reflective learning. The findings illuminate how a feminist standpoint contributes to understandings of the therapeutic relationship that centres patient subjectivity and co\u2010construction of meaning\u2010making processes to support self\u2010management of pain.\n",

        "abstract": "Using four tweets by Steven Salaita about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that resulted in the retraction of his academic job offer in September 2014 as our case study, we investigate the role of Twitter in the shaping and reception of the controversial messages. Our analysis combines Gricean pragmatics with im/politeness and hate-speech research to reveal a complex layering of potential meanings stemming from what is linguistically encoded in each tweet. Their construal as hate speech, in particular, depends on which of these potential meanings critics chose to focus upon. We account for this finding by considering the diversity of potential audiences of a tweet and suggest that the effects of context collapse on implicated meanings can be especially detrimental. Competition for attention among incoming tweets, Twitter\u2019s central affiliative function and applicable length restrictions can, nevertheless, place a premium on communicating such meanings.\n",

        "abstract": "Values represent guidelines for behavior and are important determinants of organizational performance. In addition, employee-owned enterprises (EOEs) tend to outperform traditional organizations. Thus, identifying the core values that underlie successful EOEs should provide insights\n for improved firm performance. Based on an exploratory comparative analysis of eight high-performing, employee-owned companies, a common set of values that form the basis of their cultures was identified. At one level, four core foundational values \u2013 honesty, autonomy, empowerment, and\n egalitarianism \u2013 stood out as enhancing the work experience of individual employees. At another level, four organizational values \u2013 accountability, transparency, community, and sustainability \u2013 were evident. The identified values do overlap and may serve to support, reinforce,\n or initiate each other. Moreover, these firms appear to have built management practices and policies that bolster these values. Thus, knowledge of the practices, policies, and core values should be beneficial to organizations seeking high performance.\n",

This research demonstrates that victims and offenders are more satisfied with the process and outcomes than with the courts, they are more likely to draft and complete restitution agreements, they derive psychosocial benefits, the process is less expensive, crime victims are more likely to receive apologies from offenders, and offenders are less likely to recidivate. These benefits are not necessarily uniformly distributed. This \u201cfirst wave\u201d research provides a platform for the second wave, currently underway. To contextualize these findings, current and future victim\u2010offender mediation practices are outlined.\n",

This allows CTML to express a rich set of queries towards the unification of model checking and performance evaluation. In fact, CTML covers PCTL. It can express a nontrivial subset of PLTL formulas that cannot be expressed by PCTL. The significance of this result is that the overall complexity of CTML is linear, as opposed to exponential as it is with PLTL, in the size of the operators for a given formula, and polynomial in the size of a given model. Moreover, CTML can express real-valued performance queries such as: \u201cif a system encounters a failure, what is the expected time to reach a recovery state?\u201d that cannot be expressed by a probabilistic model checking logic, because they are \u201cprobabilistic\u201d at most. Along with the specification language, we present a set of algorithms for the evaluation of the language and show proofs for their correctness. Additionally, we include an application example and show experimental results.\n",

Consequently, research on student stress is imperative, from both an organizational and an individual perspective. This research study explores the moderating role of coping skills on the relationship between self-leadership and stress among college students.\n\n**Participants:** Data from 643 full-time undergraduate students attending a 4-year public university in the mid-Atlantic region were collected in February 2017 and analyzed using a moderated regression model.\n\n**Results:** The results indicate self-leadership practices do reduce student stress levels and that this relationship is moderated by student coping skills.\n\n**Conclusion:** The findings from this study deepen our understanding of how self-leadership practices may decrease student stress and showcases self-leadership as an effective tool for reducing college student stress.\n\n**Keywords:** Coping, college students, self-leadership, stress\n",

We find that nations with heavy natural resource extraction exhibit less entrepreneurial activity, but this negative relationship is greatly reduced and even reversed in nations possessing a threshold level of governance quality. Unfortunately, the group of nations exceeding this threshold consists primarily of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members. These results support the hypothesis that the resource curse, when left unchecked by weak institutions, promotes rent\u2010seeking behaviour that harms entrepreneurship. \u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",

        "abstract": "Accurately remembering how and when one's own learning occurs is an important metacognitive skill that matures during the early school years. In two studies, the impact of a delay on this ability was examined. In Study 1, 30 children in two age groups (4\u2010year\u2010olds and 5\u2010year\u2010olds) participated in two\u2010staged learning events and were interviewed immediately after each event about the facts they had learned in the events and about how they had acquired them. Children in both age groups learned the facts, but had significant difficulty reporting on their own learning. In Study 2, 79 children in the same age range participated in one staged learning event and were given similar interviews as in Study 1, either immediately after the event or after a 2\u2010 to 3\u2010day delay. Five\u2010year\u2010olds were more accurate in their memories of learning in the delay condition than in the immediate condition, but 4\u2010year\u2010olds showed no performance differences as a function of delay. Findings are interpreted in light of developmental literature on episodic memory, source monitoring, and memory binding.\n\n## Highlights:\nHow does a delay interval between impact children's ability to accurately recall episodic memories of their own learning?Children completed staged learning events. Four\u2010 and five\u2010year\u2010olds struggled to recall instances of learning immediately, but five\u2010year\u2010olds improved after a delay.Five\u2010year\u2010olds, but not four\u2010year\u2010olds, appear to benefit from a moderate delay when recalling learning episodes. This could be due to developments in other metacognitive skills.\n\nHow does a delay interval between impact children's ability to accurately recall episodic memories of their own learning?\n\nChildren completed staged learning events.

To address this question, I highlight my experiences overseeing the game during the first 2 weeks of seven introductory IR classes.

Two other major introductory IR textbooks include International Politics: Power and Purpose in Global Affairs, by Paul D\u2019Anieri, which devotes a main section to 'theoretical approaches' and International Relations, by Joshua Goldstein and Jon C. Pevehouse, which covers 'realist theories' and 'liberal and social theories.'\n2 I used an online version of the game, which allowed me to display the game board via the projector during class and allowed students to continue playing outside of class. See Arnold (2015) for extremely helpful instructions on setting up the game using this online platform.\n3 More specifically, 70% of first Fall Semester 2015 class, 56% of second Fall Semester 2015 class, 85% of the Spring Semester 2016 class, 79% of the Fall Semester 2016 class, 76% of the Fall Semester 2017 class, 85% of the first Spring Semester 2018 class, and 88% of the second Spring Semester 2018 class participated in this study.\n4 I confronted that question of whether a theory primes students to approach simulations in particular ways during two prisoner\u2019s dilemma simulations. I administered the first of these simulations after covering neorealism; students thus had an idea of how they were expected to respond to the dilemma. They were presented, however, with the prospect of earning bonus points for defying those expectations. In some cases they did; in others they did not. I administered the second simulation after covering neoliberalism, and so I altered it from a one-round to an iterative, multiround prisoner\u2019s dilemma. I was curious to see whether students would take the insights of neoliberalism to heart, account for the 'shadow of the future,' and maximize their bonus points through ongoing, mutual cooperation. Or, would they seek vengeance for betrayals that might have occurred in the previous simulations and disregard the opportunity costs (i.e., giving up more bonus points) through a surprise defection? Going with the latter would segue into our next unit on constructivism, given its focus on norms and norm-enforcement. Again, different classes yielded different results. But when students upended theoretical expectations, they reinforced lessons about how the partiality of theories actually calls attention to their omissions and distortions.\n5 These 46 students were those who both allowed me to use their debriefing worksheets and gave me permission\u2014per IRB requirements\u2014to use their midterm essays in this study.\n\n**Additional information**\n**Notes on contributors**\nEric R.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper investigates how market-oriented reforms affect firm incentives to innovate. We utilise the market reforms enacted in Korea following the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 as an empirical setting to show why an institution-based view is crucial to understanding the factors that incentivize firms to innovate. Additionally, we draw on the competitive strategy literature to investigate how market reforms \u2013 combined with industry competition and firm-specific factors \u2013 affect innovation-related investments. Our findings suggest that market reforms positively influence both innovation input and output, but these associations are contingent on firm-specific factors.

        "abstract": "Reassembly, curated by G Douglas Barrett and Petros Touloudi\nTinos, Greece\n5 July 2017 to 31 October 2017\n\nThe free movement of bodies and objects once considered critical for the\nsmooth functioning of contemporary art has appeared, especially since 2017,\nincreasingly uncertain in this era marked by new forms of nationalism, xenophobia,\nand economic isolationism. Indeed, many artists working in this\nenvironment have found it difficult or impossible to cross once unquestionably\nopen borders, or to ship works to and from exhibitions held across a requisitely\ninternational stage. As an attempt to respond to this crisis, I, along\nwith Petros Touloudis, curated Reassembly, an exhibition held in the summer\nof 2017 on the island of Tinos, Greece. The exhibition came out of an annual\nresidency program organized by Touloudis\u2019s Tinos Quarry Platform and was\nheld at the Cultural Foundation of Tinos. Overall, we wanted to ask if there is\na critical role for music can play in the field contemporary art, especially as its\nplagued by new forms of border policing and geopolitical conflict.\n",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the connections between education for youth civic engagement and theories and strategies from public health (specifically, epidemiology). We illustrate this with four applications of epidemiologic theory to youth civic engagement: social determinants and fundamental causes, vulnerable populations and cumulative disadvantage, positive spillover, and herd immunity and critical mass. Formalizing concepts of current civics, in schools and the public, as a civic epidemic, we present a case for individual\u2010 and group\u2010level interventions based around targeted, school\u2010based, effective civic education initiatives. Grounded in epidemiological theory, such approaches call attention to the simultaneous need to improve broad civics education and ensure that particular populations receive necessary attentions.\n",

Taking an ethnographic approach to the analysis of Uzbek and Iranian migration discourse, we show how the underspecified and decontextualized information received via technology is combined with the \u201cimagined homeland\u201d in order toreconstructimages of lifethere\u2010and\u2010now. Since images of the homeland are chronotopic in nature, we argue that the reconstruction of these images can be understood asrechronotopization. The rechronotopized image, then, operates as a lens through which migrants socially position themselves relative to the homeland. More specifically, we show how the conflict between prior images and rechronotopized images are invoked to construct difference and discuss disconnection. Thus, while technology facilitates connection, we argue that because it reminds migrants of how things have changed since they left, it may also lead to feelings of disconnection.\n",

        "abstract": "Undergraduate psychology majors need a broad base of knowledge in order to be viewed as competent graduates. In addition to acquiring basic knowledge, the American Psychological Association (APA) has guidelines for applied knowledge as well. In order to ensure a broad base of knowledge, teachers therefore need to know what the important psychological concepts are not only in both basic and applied areas of psychology. We examined key concepts across five applied areas of psychology and identified 30 key concepts that occur in two or more applied areas of psychology. It is evident from our findings that there is notable intersection between applied psychology and basic psychological science but also important applied concepts that stand alone from basic psychology. We discuss how these findings are directly relevant to APA\u2019s undergraduate learning goal of psychological literacy.\n",

        "abstract": "## Abstract\nPhysical education teacher education programs provide teacher candidates with the knowledge, skills and dispositions required to impact student learning. Over the course of a long and successful career, however, quality physical education teachers must continue to adapt to the changing demands of their profession. The professional growth that results in the development of quality physical education teachers begins with their entry into the undergraduate professional education program, continues with their initial employment, and matures over the course of their professional career. Physical education teacher education programs provide experiences that lay the foundation for continued professional development and learning over the span of a professional teaching career. The purpose of this article is to share a descriptive model of sequential professional growth and examples of developmental activities that can be integrated into a teacher education program to facilitate this growth. The professional growth and development activities are described within the context of the following four stages: (1) awareness stage, (2) exploration stage, (3) connection stage, and (4) professional stage. Suggestions for developing a professional \u201croad map\u201d for charting the activities completed by candidates over the course of their undergraduate education are also presented with a list of suggested activities.\n\n## Notes on contributors\n- **Okseon Lee**: Associate professor in the Department of Physical Education at Seoul National University in Seoul, Republic of Korea.\n- **Dean M.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT My post-structuralist feminist reading of the antenatal and birthing practices of women (N = 25) living in a basti in India makes visible how the meanings of maternal experiences constituted as our ways open discursive spaces for the mothers and dais as procreators to: challenge (i.e., question the authority of), co-opt (i.e., conditionally adopt), and judge (i.e., employ sanctioned criteria to regulate) competing knowledge production forms. In critiquing maternal knowledge as feminist discourse, the women\u2019s strategies contribute theoretically to an integrative construction of care by reclaiming displaced knowledge discourses and diversity in meaning production. Pragmatically, consciousness-raising collectives comprising the mothers and dais can cocreate narratives of our ways of maternal experiences articulated in public discourse to sustain equitability of knowledge traditions in migrant urban Third World contexts. Acknowledgments The author thanks the two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments on earlier versions of this manuscript and is grateful to the women and children of the basti for their generous participation in sharing their knowledge of our ways. Funding This research was funded by the author\u2019s university faculty research grant. Notes 1. WHO defines maternal mortality as \u201cthe death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to\u2026pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes\u201d (2016). Women in developing countries are 33 times more likely to die from preventable maternal-related causes compared with those in developed countries (WHO, Citation2017). Ninety-nine percent of maternal deaths occur in developing countries\u2014one-fifth of which occur in India (WHO, Citation2016). The MMR (maternal mortality rate per 100,000 women) reflects the challenges of bridging the gendered health inequity of access and exclusion. 2. ACHA\u2019s mandate involves the detection of conditions (e.g., maternal anemia) and management of high-risk pregnancies including direct obstetric causes of maternal mortality (e.g., postpartum hemorrhage, obstructed labor, DMCH, Citation2005). 3. The Delhi Development Authority identifies unplanned colonies as: urbanized village, jhuggi jhoppari (J.J.) clusters, J.J. resettlement, slum rehabilitation, unauthorized, and regularized-unauthorized colonies (Government of Delhi, Citationn.d.). 4. Policy reports identify factors such as threat to female modesty, caste discrimination, and cost as influencing access to healthcare facilities by migrant women and their families. The Sample Registration System that tracks Millennium Development Goals (United Nations UN, Citation2015) on child mortality and maternal health finds that Delhi, with high rural\u2013urban migration, has the highest MMR (> 300; Office of Registrar General, Government of India, Citation2011). 5. A vitiated Vata (one of the three doshas) in Ayurvedic medicine is considered to cause maternal morbidity and concerns. To balance Vata, herbs and food appropriate to each month of the pregnancy are eaten per specific rules (e.g., not eating pungent food).\n",

However, the choice among competing vendors that offer the same economic incentives is unclear. Relationship trade-offs and asymmetric power between retailers and vendors may influence these decisions, such that future economic incentives, social incentives, and power asymmetry are likely decision-making factors. Using commitment theory and an experimental design, this study determines that calculative commitment, power asymmetry, and various forms of loyalty commitment have significant decision-making impacts. With greater power asymmetry, calculative commitment exerts a stronger impact than comprehensive loyalty commitment; in low power asymmetry conditions, comprehensive loyalty commitment has more impact.\n",

Osman, and Ruby L. Orth\n\n**Abstract**  The purpose of this study was to examine empathy with a hypothetical rapist based on type of sexual perpetration experience (i.e., none, nonrape perpetrators, rapists who do not admit to \u201crape,\u201d and rapists who admit to \u201crape\u201d). Undergraduate men (n = 385) completed the Rape-Perpetrator Empathy Scale (Smith and Frieze 2003) and the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Perpetration (Koss et al. 2007), which first asks behavior-based questions, without using the word \u201crape,\u201d to identify rapists and those with other sexual perpetration experience, and then asks if they \u201cmay have ever raped someone.\u201d None of the respondents admitted to \u201crape,\u201d but participants whose survey responses indicated prior behavior consistent with rape (rapists) reported greater empathy than those who indicated no behaviors consistent with any type of sexual perpetration (nonperpetrators). Respondents who indicated prior behavior consistent with sexual perpetration, but not rape (nonrape perpetrators) did not differ from either rapists or nonperpetrators. Committing rape may be associated with greater rape perpetrator empathy due to similarity in experience.\n\n**Published In**  Violence and Gender Volume 4 \u2022 Issue Number 1 \u2022 March 2017 Pages: 25 - 26\n\n**Copyright**  Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.\n\n**Authors Affiliations**\n- Suzanne L.

        "abstract": "## Abstract\nFounded on a rich tradition of community engagement, social work\u2019s commitment to macro practice has waxed and waned throughout its short professional history. Despite an ethical mandate to advocate for social and economic justice, there is a retrenching emphasis on macro practice within social work education. This circumstance affects the profession\u2019s commitment to human rights and social justice as social work students are often unable to actively engage in change-making activities. Many students graduate without the knowledge and skills needed to enact systemic change in their agencies, communities, states, or nation. This case study will explore the use of experiential learning methods to challenge carceral power through the demonstration of macro practice skills, which are essential for challenging the status quo of practices and policies that sustain oppressive systems. This case study details the organization and facilitation of \u2018Know Your Rights\u2019 (KYR) trainings, which educate community members about their Constitutional rights when confronted by the police. Through a successful collaboration between the American Civil Liberties Union, a social work program, and a dozen community organizations, the KYR trainings, conducted by over 60 BSW students engaged in three macro practice courses, were delivered in a rural community on the east coast with nearly 400 community members and students in attendance.\n\n### Keywords:\nSocial justice, experiential learning, macro social work practice\n",

This letter uses a dataset generated via machine learning methods to count the total number of federal regulations imposed on the beer value chain. We show that 94,212 federal regulatory constraints influenced the beer value chained in 2012, with the majority of constraints being imposed at the brewery level.

        "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in living organisms can generate oxidative stress, which contributes to cell damage associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Studying responses to oxidative stress in model organisms, like the nematode wormCaenorhabditis elegans, may provide insight into basic underlying cellular mechanisms shared with humans. MRCK\u20101 (myotonic dystrophy kinase\u2010related Cdc42 binding kinase), a highly conserved intracellular kinase, is activated by the G\u2010protein, Cdc42, which contains a redox sensitive motif. Previous studies have shown that MRCK\u20101 regulates cell polarity and cytoskeleton reorganization, particularly during cell division and in response to cellular damage. To determine if MRCK\u20101 plays a role in other cellular defense responses, we are testing if RNA interference (RNAi) ofmrck\u20101results in the production of more ROS under stressed conditions. The cell permeable fluorescent ROS indicator, carboxymethyl dichlorodihydrofluorescein derivative, CM\u2010H2DCFDA, shows significantly increased fluorescence in hydrogen peroxide\u2010treated worms when quantified using the SpectraMax microplate reader. Oxidative stress conditions were induced with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence of CM\u2010H2DCFDA, and fluorescence was measured over a period of 20 hours. Measuring the fluorescence of worms exposed to dsRNA from two independentmrck\u20101RNAi constructs,mrck\u2010mandmrck\u2010s, enables the quantification of ROS levels when MRCK\u20101 function is decreased. Exploring the levels of ROS in RNAi\u2010treatedC. elegansmay give further insight into the cellular role of MRCK\u20101 both in worms and in humans.\n\nSupport or Funding Information\n\nSpecial acknowledgments to the Salisbury University Department of Biological Sciences, the Henson Undergraduate Research Award, and the National Science Foundation MRI Acquisition Award DBI\u20101337534 for support.\n",

        "abstract": "Inspired by spontaneously fermented beers, such as Belgian Lambic beers, American breweries have moved beyond using exclusively domesticated strains of the beer\u2010making yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to experimenting with a variety of different yeast species to produce unique flavors and aromas. The so\u2010called \u201cfunky,\u201d \u201cwild,\u201d and \u201csour,\u201d beers are produced using uncommon microorganisms either during or after the primary ferment. The goal of our research is to isolate, identify, and characterize wild yeasts from the local environment and to make them available to both commercial and craft brewers for making novel beers. The use of locally\u2010sourced yeasts could also be used by commercial brewers as a marketing angle, as is often done with local hops, grains, or water. As a source of wild yeasts, we obtained various wild and cultivated fruits growing in rural Maryland and a sample of Belgium\u2010style ale being aged in used oak wine barrels at Evolution Craft Brewing Company (Salisbury, MD). Yeast colonies were isolated using yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD) agar plates containing antibiotics and identified by colony morphology as well as PCR amplification and sequencing of the 5.8S rRNA genes. The identified yeasts belong toSaccharomyces,Pichia,Candida, Fusarium,Torulaspora,and, most interestingly,Brettanomycesgenera. TheBrettanomycesyeast, which was isolated from the wine barrel ale, is normally considered a wine spoilage yeast but increasingly is being employed to create \u201cfunky\u201d and sour flavors in beer. The growth and fermentation abilities of eight different yeast isolates were analyzed for growth in different liquid medias (YPD, hopped barley\u2010malt extract, and merlot grape juice) using 96\u2010well plates and spectroscopy. Growth rates were calculated using a modified grofit package in RStudio. Ethanol production will be determined using a colorimetric assay. Thus far, the most compelling discovery is a wild strain ofSaccharomyces cerevisiaethat grows comparable to a commercially\u2010available brewing yeast and produces pleasant, fruity aromas when fermenting barley malt extract. The complete characterization of these wild yeasts will be reported in order to identify novel wild yeasts that can be domesticated for local craft brewers.\n\nSupport or Funding Information\n\nSpecial acknowledgments to the Salisbury University Department of Biological Sciences, the Henson Undergraduate Research Award, Evolution Craft Brewery, and the National Science Foundation for funding and equipment, as well as Dr. Philip D.

        "abstract": "Ubiquitination is an essential, dynamic post\u2010translational modification that regulates a diverse set of cellular processes. Ligation of the small peptide ubiquitin (Ub) onto substrate proteins by E3 Ub ligases can change protein localization, activity or stability. The most common outcome for Ub\u2010tagged proteins is degradation via the 26S proteasome. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) reverse the effects of ubiquitination by removing Ub from tagged substrates. In animals, Ubiquitin\u2010specific protease (USP) 12 and USP46 are related DUBs that regulate key proteins in important growth and differentiation signaling pathways. USP12 and USP46 each form trimeric complexes with two WD\u2010repeat (WDR) proteins, WDR20 and WDR48. The WDR proteins activate the enzymatic abilities of the DUBs while potentially serving as substrate receptors. Numerous animal and fungal DUBs are bound and activated by specific WDR proteins. InArabidopsis, Ub\u2010specific proteases 3 (AtUBP3) and 4 (AtUBP4) are related DUBs that have significant sequence similarities to animal USP12/46. Genetic studies have shown AtUBP3/4 are essential for proper pollen development and transmission. It is not yet known if WDR proteins bind and activate DUBs in plants. We have identified At2g37160 as a likelyArabidopsisWDR20 homolog based on amino acid sequence homology and the number and organization of WD motifs. We have shown At2g37160 (AtWDR20) interacts with both AtUBP3 and AtUBP4 in the yeast two\u2010hybrid system. Biochemical characterization using recombinant proteins shows AtWDR20 increases the DUB activity of AtUBP3 over nine\u2010fold. A yeast two\u2010hybrid screen of anArabidopsiscDNA library using AtWDR20 as bait revealed interactions between AtWDR20 and two different E3 Ub ligases: Myb\u201030 Interacting E3 Ub ligase (MIEL1) and CHY Zinc\u2010finger and Ring Protein 1 (CHYR1). Interactions between a DUB\u2010associated WDR protein and E3 Ub ligases is intriguing, and implies AtWDR20 may function on both sides of the Ub cycle or is itself a target of ubiquitination.In plantaandin vitroanalyses will further characterize the interactions between AtWDR20, AtUBP3, and these E3 ligases.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTQualitative classroom data from video recordings and students' written work can play important roles in improving mathematics instruction. In order to take full advantage of these data sources, it is helpful to have a strong analytic lens to orient one's reflections on the data. One promising analytic lens is the National Research Council's five stands of mathematical proficiency framework. It prompts teachers to examine the extent to which their students have attained conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, strategic competence, adaptive reasoning, and productive dispositions. This article describes how a pair of prospective teachers used the five strands to analyze and reflect upon qualitative classroom data from a series of lessons they taught. The insights gained during the process can help others anticipate dynamics involved in using the five strands framework during practitioner research and reflection on classroom data.KEYWORDS: Assessmentcurriculummiddle schoolpre-service teacher educationAcknowledgmentThis article is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number DRL-1356001.

This structure leads to situations where future competitors (the shadow effect) and previous effort (the spillover effect) affect current performance. Using data from the 2009-2014 NBA playoffs, results here find that, when a future opponent is known, a series favorite is significantly more likely to win a game when the future opponent is weaker than expected. Estimates also provide evidence that greater previous effort by teams increases the probability the series favorite wins a game.\n",

        "abstract": "North America is home to both native and invasive earthworms acting as ecosystem engineers as they build burrows that can serve as habitat for other species or otherwise alter soil structure, affecting nutrient cycling and other ecosystem processes. Here I determine where and what earthworm species commonly occur in my study area, and compare effects of native and invasive earthworms on the common woodland salamander,Plethodon cinereus, in field surveys and laboratory experiments. The native earthwormEisenoides carolinensiswas the most common earthworm, followed by two invasive speciesDendrobaena octaedraandOctolasion tyrtaeum. The presence ofO. tyrtaeumwas associated with a narrower O\u2010horizon (i.e., organic layer in the soil). Using structural equation modeling to explore direct and indirect pathways of these three most common earthworm species on salamanders, I foundO. tyrtaeumoccurrence was negatively correlated with nighttime salamander counts, a proxy for total salamander numbers, mediated by negative effects on O\u2010horizon depth and microinvertebrate numbers. In the laboratory,O. tyrtaeumandD. octaedraconsumed more leaf litter per gram of earthworm per day than the nativeE. carolinensis. However, salamanders consumed earthworms and used burrows of all native and invasive species of earthworms similarly. The potential for negative indirect effects of the invasive earthwormO. tyrtaeumonP. cinereuswas demonstrated both in the field and laboratory, highlighting that seemingly small differences between native and invasive ecosystem engineers have the potential to significantly alter the effects of these closely related native and invasive organisms.\n",

        "abstract": "We evaluated differences in the15N isotopic enrichment factors of trophic amino acids (AA) for protistan (microzooplankton) and metazoan (mesozooplankton) consumers, testing the hypothesis that \u03b415N of alanine (ala) increases in both consumer types, while glutamic acid (glu) enriches mainly in mesozooplankton. AA \u03b415N values were measured for dinoflagellate and ciliate grazers and their respective algal prey (Oxyrrhis marina/Dunaliella tertiolectaandFavellasp./Heterocapsa triquetra) in four two\u2010stage chemostat experiments, including treatments with different nitrogen\u00a0:\u00a0phosphorous nutrient ratios and light/dark recycling conditions. Propagation of AA15N enrichment to a metazoan consumer was also assessed in two\u2010 and three\u2010stage chemostat experiments simulating simple \u201cclassical\u201d (Calanus pacificusand the diatomThalassiosira weissflogii) and \u201cmultivorous\u201d (C. pacificus,O. marina, andD. tertiolecta) food chains. We found small or negligible15N\u2010enrichment of glu for both protistan grazers, while ala enrichment was consistently greater and similar to that in metazoan consumers. Ala and glu \u03b415N values were both highly elevated inC. pacificusrelative to prey, and enrichment was higher with autotrophic diets. These laboratory results suggest that ala may be used as an alternate, accurate isotopic proxy for quantifying protistan contributions to trophic structure in aquatic systems.\n",

The analysis occurred during a multi-year project aimed at prompting communities to adopt clean indoor air policies. The results showed that most editorials were about tobacco restrictions or ordinances, were neutral in tone, and provided factual information about tobacco control. More editorials were negatively slanted vs. positively slanted toward tobacco control. Most editorials with positive tones were published in newspapers in towns that already had clean indoor air policies. We concluded that editorials might hold increased weight in spurring change, as the percentage of smokers in a city is unrelated to the town enacting a clean indoor air ordinance.\n",

In Study 1, patients with fibromyalgia syndrome ( N = 22) reported on mental and physical adjustment, social interaction, and reappraisal of their illness. Dispositional humor was associated with reduced distress and fewer physical symptoms. Study 2 ( N = 109) examined undergraduates\u2019 reports of stressful events. Dispositional, self-enhancing, affiliative, and self-defeating humor showed direct effects on distress, which were mediated by social interaction and reappraisal. Moreover, dispositional and aggressive humor showed stress-buffering effects. Study 3 ( N = 105) examined undergraduates\u2019 adjustment to the September 11, 2001, attacks at 1 and 3 months postattack. At T1, affiliative humor showed a stress-buffering effect on distress. Social interaction mediated the relation of self-enhancing humor with reduced T1 distress, and mediated relations of aggressive and self-defeating humor with greater distress. Relations of T1 dispositional and self-defeating humor to changes in T2 distress were mediated by reappraisal.\n",

        "abstract": "This letter is a response to a recent article in this Journal (Reed, J. J.; Brandriet, A. R.; Holme, T. A. J. Chem. Educ.2017, 94, 3\u201310) about characterization of the presence of scientific practices in assessment items. We are writing in response to the recently published paper by Reed, Brandriet, and Holme. (1) This paper uses an early version of the Three-Dimensional Learning Assessment Protocol (3D-LAP), which we developed as part of a transformation initiative at Michigan State University. The 3D-LAP is now published (2) and is somewhat different from the version used by the authors of the J. Chem. Educ. paper. The earlier version of the 3D-LAP contained a characterization of the \u201cimplicit\u201d presence of a scientific practice, which we later removed because we felt that it did not best reflect the intent of A Framework for K\u201312 Science Education. (3) We found that questions in which the practice was \u201cimplicit\u201d do not have the potential to elicit evidence of student reasoning. We want to clarify and encourage the use of the 3D-LAP in its published form. For example, in the 3D-LAP, we claim that a question can only elicit evidence of the practice Developing and Using Models if it has all of the following features, the last being most important in our view:\n\n1. Question gives an event, observation, or phenomenon for the student to explain or make a prediction about.\n2. Question gives a representation or asks student to construct a representation.\n3. Question asks student to explain or make a prediction about the event, observation, or phenomenon.\n4. Question asks student to provide the reasoning that links the representation to their explanation or prediction.\n\nWe find that the reasoning component is most often absent from the typical assessment tasks that we ask of students, and it is this component that was missing in our earlier version of the protocol which provided an \u201cimplicit\u201d characterization of assessment items. Finally, we caution that the presence of a representation does not necessarily engage students in the practice of modeling. We are encouraged by the interest of our research community in developing, using, and analyzing assessments that engage students in scientific practices; we look forward to continuing this work together.\n",

        "abstract": "Both environmental fluctuations and physical characteristics of amphibians (e.g., body size, sex, or age class) affect their growth. Eastern Red-backed Salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, are often used as indicators of habitat quality in eastern North American forests. Most of the research concerning growth in this species has focused on the influence of body size, rather than on other external or temporal factors that might affect growth. We performed a mark\u2013recapture study spanning multiple years and seasons to compare the growth of individuals of P. cinereus across temporally variable environmental conditions. Unsurprisingly, the most significant factor affecting growth was body size. Growth also varied seasonally and annually, with greater growth of salamanders during a mild winter and more growth in 2014 than 2013. Sex-age class did interact with yearly fluctuations as evidenced by juveniles, but not adults, having reduced growth in 2014. However, color morph did not have an effect on growth. We concluded that fluctuating environmental conditions, as well as body size, exerted effects on the salamanders' growth. This study adds to our understanding of the factors affecting growth in terrestrial salamanders and provides context for past and future studies of body size and abundance in this ecologically important species.\n",

Examining the grammar of visuality in which typographic choice, toponymic-allusion, punctuational detail, as well as onomastics and embedded speech acts emerge ripe in literal and metaphoric meaning, the paper demonstrates how acts of intertextual chaining of political history and candidate biography re-affirm the need for interpretive frameworks which are dynamic \u2013 not static \u2013 and which are simultaneously incorporative of exophoric text-context accounts of witnessed signage. The in-built potential of campaign yard signage in triggering contagious and conspicuous acts of affective stance-taking particularly in neighborhoods of geospatial contiguity are examined both for how they fit into LL research, as well as for how they prod further innovation in its interdisciplinary-inspired and evolving frameworks of analysis.\n",

Based on a paired sample of 161 legal secretaries and their managers, results indicated that managers used the attitudes and behaviors displayed by employees (strong extra-role performance and enhanced work engagement) as cues from which to base their perceptions of employees\u2019 affective commitment to the organization. In turn, employees perceived as highly committed to the organization experienced enhanced content and structural career growth opportunities. Moreover, the relation between managers\u2019 perceptions of employees\u2019 organizational commitment and content career growth opportunities was stronger for employees perceived as also highly committed to their careers than for employees perceived as less committed to their careers.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nRural families are burdened by lost time from work, extensive time spent navigating the system of care, and long wait times. Colocating social care and medical care services in the primary care office would expand the availability of shallow end services, allow for triaging of concerns and the reduction of wait times for initial screening and assessment services. The Maryland Behavioral Health Integration in Pediatric Primary Care colocated model involves collaborations between primary care providers and master\u2019s-level social work interns to enhance behavioral health outcomes for children and families in rural Maryland. Findings from the first three years\u2019 program evaluations provide much valuable information about challenges to program success and utilization. Some of the findings indicate that the primary care providers\u2019 understanding of the social work identity in a colocated context affects how often the interns are asked to consult and how they are perceived by families. Feedback from the interns indicates that feelings of isolation as social workers in the host environments affects their experiences in the field placement and with the families. Finally, families\u2019 aversion to stigma related to working with a social worker likely affects their engagement with the interns.\n\nKEYWORDS: Behavioral health, colocation, pediatric integrated care, rural social work\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article provides an empirical examination of high-tech firm location data from 1953 to 1990 to show a dramatic shift in geographic centre of what is now called Silicon Valley. Universities (most notably Stanford), venture capital and law firms acted as magnets for divisions of established firms and local start-ups. These institutions combined with the Santa Clara County\u2019s available land to pull the high-tech region\u2019s epicentre south-eastwards from San Francisco, an early source of investment capital and legal expertise. These findings add another element (spatial change) for consideration in explaining the evolution of industry clusters.\n\nKeywords: High-tech clusters, industrial location, geography, regional Silicon Valley\n\nNotes\n1.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n\nBackground: Mental health service is underutilized in the United States. Adolescent and young adults, including college students, are especially unlikely to seek professional help for mental illness. This issue presents a concern, because signs and symptoms commonly appear during this part of growth and development. \n\nPurpose: The Health Belief Model (HBM) was used to explore perceptions about mental illness and mental health service utilization and self-medication among college students who may or may not have a history of mental illness. \n\nMethods: A survey exploring HBM constructs and self-medicating behaviors was distributed to a population of university undergraduate students ages 18\u201324. A concurrent focus group of mental health care providers investigated practitioner perceptions of mental health care utilization. Results of both were analyzed for common themes. \n\nResults: Sociocultural concerns and challenges navigating through the system were the primary perceived barriers to accessing mental health services. Primary care providers were reported as a vital cue to action. Alcohol, marijuana, and prescription medications were the most frequent and preferred substances used for self-medication. \n\nTranslation to Health Education Practice: The most apparent theme is the need for education and continuing school partnerships. Doing so can offer diagnosis and treatment and foster personal and social skill development.\n",

Using the stereotype content model as a framework, we investigated warmth and competence stereotypes associated with employees with anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. Employees with these disorders were perceived to be low in warmth and competence, and stereotypes about individuals with anxiety were relatively more positive than those with depression or bipolar. This study also proposed and tested the extent to which stereotypes predicted work\u2010related social distancing intentions. We found that two characteristics moderated this relationship: gender and social dominance orientation. We discuss practical and theoretical implications as they pertain to improving the experiences and well\u2010being of employees with mental illness.\n",

        "abstract": "Zebrin II (ZII; a.k.a. aldolase C) is expressed heterogeneously in Purkinje cells (PCs) such that there are sagittal stripes of high expression (ZII+) interdigitated with stripes of little or no expression (ZII\u2212). The pigeon flocculus receives visual\u2010optokinetic information and is important for generating compensatory eye movements. It consists of 4 sagittal zones based on PC complex spike activity (CSA) in response to rotational optokinetic stimuli. There are two zones where CSA responds best to rotation about the vertical axis (VA), interdigitated with two zones where CSA responds best to rotation about an horizontal axis (HA). These optokinetic zones relate to the ZII stripes in folium IXcd of the flocculus, such that an optokinetic zone spans a ZII+/\u2212 pair: the HA zones span the P5+/\u2212 and P7+/\u2212 ZII stripe pairs, whereas the VA zones correspond to ZII stripe pairs P4+/\u2212 and P6+/\u2212. In the present study, we used fluorescent retrograde tracing to determine the olivary inputs to the ZII+ and ZII\u2212 stripes within the functional pairs. We found that separate but adjacent areas of the medial column of the inferior olive (mcIO) project to the ZII+ and ZII\u2212 stripes within each of the functional pairs. Thus, although a ZII+/\u2212 stripe pair represents a functional unit in the pigeon flocculus insofar as the CSA of all PCs in the stripe pair encodes similar sensory information, the olivary inputs to the ZII+ and ZII\u2212 stripes arise from different, although adjacent, regions of the mcIO.\n",

        "abstract": "This textual examination extends understandings of how complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers constitute preventive care in their discourse by identifying the frame of breaking boundaries referencing relational, structural, and philosophical orientations in their practice with their clients. Analysis of semistructured, in-depth interviews with CAM providers ( n = 17) reveals that the frame of breaking boundaries was comprised of three themes: finding one\u2019s own strength; I don\u2019t prescribe, so I\u2019m exploring; and ground yourself, and have an escape route. The themes describe preventive care by identifying how CAM providers negotiate their relational positionality in connecting with clients, structural positionality within the field of health care, and philosophical positionality within the ontological understandings that guide how health is defined and conceptualized. The study contributes toward enhancing diverse understandings of constituting preventive care in practice and suggests pragmatic implications for addressing biomedical provider communication with their patients seeking CAM care alongside conventional treatments.\n",

This study examines four factors related to consumers\u2019 social media engagement and online privacy protection behaviors. Regulatory focus, social exchange, and marketing relationship theories explain the online consumer personal information share-and-protect model developed. Consumers aged 18\u201364 years across the United States participated in this survey research. The results suggest that while personal privacy violation experience and perceived secondary control of one's personal information are influential antecedents, privacy concerns and trust in social media websites mediate each of these respectively. The findings suggest that promotion- and prevention-related behaviors regarding personal information align with the orientation of the antecedents, indicating that regulatory focus theory shows promise for examining the privacy paradox. We conclude by developing a matrix that integrates regulatory focus and social exchange theories to guide future research.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTUtilizing Orbe\u2019s co-cultural theory and Bourdieu\u2019s theories of capital, this study examines the lived experiences and the communicative interactions employed by members of seven multicultural families in South Korea. Findings show the intertwined roles of economic capital, social capital, cultural capital and symbolic capital with co-cultural communication orientations, when interacting with members of the majority group. Particularly, findings reveal differences between Korean husbands and immigrant wives. For Korean husbands, economic and social capital are the most critical influential factors in their choices of communication orientations, while for immigrant wives, cultural and symbolic capital are most significant. Additionally, contrary to previous research, Confucianism and patriarchy played key roles in the marginalization of Korean men in multicultural families and influenced their co-cultural communication orientations.KEYWORDS: Co-cultural theory, Bourdieu, capital, multicultural families, immigrant women. Acknowledgements: The authors would like to thank Dr Jeanne McPherson, Dr Joe Miller, and Dr Masahiro Yamamoto who provided thoughtful comments on the very first draft of this manuscript as well as three anonymous reviewers. Notes: 1. Cho-Seon-Jok (\uc870\uc120\uc871) is the term used by mainstream Chinese to refer to Koreans as one of many ethnic minorities in mainland China. In Korea, the term Cho-Seon-Jok (\uc870\uc120\uc871) refers to ethnic Koreans from China. Because we find this terminology problematic and supportive of systems of othering, we use the term \u201cethnic Koreans from China,\u201d or EKC. The EKC women in this study referred to themselves as \u201cpeople from China\u201d (\uc911\uad6d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4). 2. Multicultural Family (Da-Mun-Hwa-Ga-Jok; \ub2e4\ubb38\ud654\uac00\uc871) in Korea refers to any family which consists of a native Korean citizen, his/her non-native Korean spouse who obtained Korean citizenship through marriage immigration, and their offspring (Lee, Citation2010). Several different terms are used interchangeably, but multicultural family (Da-Mun-Hwa-Ga-Jok; \ub2e4\ubb38\ud654\uac00\uc871) is the most commonly used term in Korea. 3. Gye (\uacc4) is a traditional private trust fund where members deposit a small amount of money on a monthly basis, and take turns withdrawing a lump sum share. In addition to financially helping each other, the Gye (\uacc4) is a social network, particularly for people in rural communities who do not have professional networks. Gye (\uacc4) in Korean society is similar to the \u201cHui\u201d (Sandel, Citation2000, p. 81) in Taiwan. Refer to Sandel\u2019s (Citation2000) work for detailed information about the advantages and risks of joining Hui as well as how it works.\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis article presents a summation of the field\u2019s past contributions to understanding the nature of undergraduate reading practices and meaning making processes in relation to contemporary perspectives of disciplinary literacies. In presenting a synthesis of over 40 studies across interdisciplinary journals, the goal was to construct a generalized understanding of the field\u2019s conversations about undergraduate reading and the extent to which disciplinary literacy approaches foreground them. Analysis revealed that while the past work of postsecondary scholars has considerably influenced the field\u2019s knowledge base of postsecondary reading issues, attempts to understand reading within authentic disciplinary contexts remains generally obscured from modern prospects of disciplinary literacies, offering opportunities for advancing the next 50 years of reading scholarship.KEYWORDS: college reading, disciplinary literacy, higher educationAdditional informationNotes on contributorsHeather D.

We also explore the conditions under which teams rely on perceived expertise versus social status in determining influence relationships in teams. To do so, we present a contingency model in which the salience of expertise and social status depends on the types of intragroup conflicts. Using multiwave survey data from 50 student project teams with 320 members at a large national research institute located in South Korea, we found that both actual expertise and social status had direct and indirect effects on member influence through perceived expertise. Furthermore, perceived expertise at the early stage of team projects is driven by social status, whereas perceived expertise at the later stage of a team project is mainly driven by actual expertise. Finally, we found that members who are being perceived as experts are more influential when task conflict is high or when relationship conflict is low. We discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice.\n",

        "abstract": "Eastern Puerto Rico and the surrounding Caribbean experienced a severe drought in 2015 that resulted in record\u2010low reservoir and river levels. Rainfall deficits in April and May, which represent the period when the drought began, were more severe in 2015 than recent droughts of record. While El Ni\u00f1o has been associated with drought in the Caribbean, onset of the 2015 drought was strongly associated with lower\u2010than\u2010average values of a recently developed tool used by weather forecasters in San Juan, the G\u00e1lvez\u2010Davison Index (GDI), which is used to measure the potential for thunderstorm development and rainfall. Persistently low GDI values indicate strong and frequent intrusions of hot, dry air in the low to middle troposphere, suppressing convection, both locally and in development regions for tropical waves that impact Puerto Rico. The Saharan Air Layer (SAL) is largely responsible for this anomalously hot, dry air, which produced thermodynamically stable conditions and limited thunderstorms and rainfall. Moreover, higher\u2010than\u2010normal aerosol concentrations, typically associated with SAL intrusion over the Caribbean, were recorded in April and May 2015. A comparison to advanced very high resolution radiometer aerosol optical thickness demonstrates that higher Caribbean aerosols in the early rainfall season, particularly June, are associated with decreased rainfall in eastern Puerto Rico. Results here demonstrate a direct link between the early and more pronounced SAL intrusions into the Caribbean and the suppression of the early rainfall season. More broadly, a reduction in the GDI and increase in the trade wind inversion was associated with reduced early season rainfall in the eastern Caribbean.\n",

        "abstract": "Female preferences for males producing their calls just ahead of their neighbours, leader preferences, are common in acoustically communicating insects and anurans. While these preferences have been well studied, their evolutionary origins remain unclear. We tested whether females gain a fitness benefit by mating with leading males inNeoconocephalus ensigerkatydids. We mated leading and following males with random females and measured the number and quality ofF1, the number ofF2and the heritability of the preferred male trait. We found that females mating with leaders and followers did not differ in the number ofF1orF2offspring. Females mating with leading males had offspring that were in better condition than those mating with following males suggesting a benefit in the form of higher quality offspring. We found no evidence that the male trait, the production of leading calls, was heritable. This suggests that there is no genetic correlate for the production of leading calls and that the fitness benefit gained by females must be a direct benefit, potentially mediated by seminal proteins. The presence of benefits indicates that leader preference is adaptive inN.\u00a0ensiger, which may explain the evolutionary origin of leader preference; further tests are required to determine whether fitness benefits can explain the phylogenetic distribution of leader preference inNeoconocephalus. The absence of heritability will prevent leader preference from becoming coupled with or exaggerating the male trait and prevent females from gaining a \u2018sexy\u2010sons\u2019 benefit, weakening the overall selection for leader preference.\n",

        "abstract": "This study examines factors related to the effectiveness of mobile advertising. Using a large data set with 115,899 records of ad tap-through from a mobile advertising company in China, the authors identify that the influencing factors for advertisement tap through are application type, mobile operators, scrolling frequency, and regional income level. They use a logit model to analyze how the probability of advertisement tap through is related to the identified factors. The results show that application type, mobile operators, scrolling frequency, and the regional income level are positively correlated with the likelihood whether users would tap on certain types of advertising. In addition, they use the Bayesian network model to estimate the conditional probability for a user to tap on an advertisement in an application after the user already taps on another advertisement in the same application. Based on the findings, the authors propose strategies for mobile advertisers to engage in effective and targeted mobile advertising.\n",

        "abstract": "Given the prevalence of and consequences associated with mental illness in the workplace, we believe this review is both critical and timely for researchers and practitioners. This systematic review broadens the extant literature in both theoretical and practical ways in an effort to help lay a foundation for the organizational scholarship of employees with mental illness, a group that has traditionally been underrepresented in the management and industrial-organizational psychology literatures. After defining and conceptualizing mental illness as a social identity, we systematically review the existing empirical research on employees with mental illness across multiple fields of study. Using research that accounts for individual, other, and organizational perspectives, we present a model that outlines the performance, employment, career, and discriminatory outcomes that characterize the experiences of individuals with mental illness as well as individual and organizational strategies that moderate the relationship between having a mental illness and experiencing those outcomes. Together, this article provides a synthesis of what is known about employees with mental illness while also highlighting avenues for future scholarly attention.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTAdopting an online ethnographic approach, we examine the linguistic/semiotic practices and ideologies of \u201cpurism\u201d among Tatar and Iranian Azerbaijani Facebook users. We argue that purification practices can be understood as identity work, the outcome of which is often not an etymologically \u201cpurer\u201d language but a (perceived) \u201cpurer\u201d and more \u201cauthentic\u201d identity. We show that top-down standardization in Tatar has resulted in more homogenized ideologies regarding \u201cpure\u201d language and \u201cauthentic\u201d identity, compared to the more heterogeneous ideologies among Iranian Azerbaijanis. Furthermore, we argue that since these communities rarely use the written form of their languages in off-line contexts, their purification practices are profoundly limited to metapragmatic discourses; however, social media provides a unique venue to also exercise these ideologies linguistically/semiotically. Finally, unlike previous scholarship that has focused on the informality of language use on social media, we illustrate how social media turns out to be a platform to practice formal language.KEYWORDS: Azerbaijani/Azerilanguage and identitylanguage ideologieslinguistic purism/purificationsocial mediaTatarAcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Rakesh Bhatt, Lydia Catedral, and Kate Lyons for their helpful comments on the initial draft of this paper.

Little is known regarding the cultural influences on health professionals' attitudes toward the discussion of ACP in China.\n\n## Objective:\nTo better understand attitudes toward ACP among Chinese healthcare professionals in China and the influence of cultural factors such as filial piety, or xi\u00e0o.\n\n## Methods:\nA mixed methods study was used. This study reports the results of a descriptive cross-sectional survey of physicians, nurses and social workers with experience in palliative and end-of-life care.\n\n## Results:\nSome 102 completed surveys were obtained. Most Chinese health professionals had an overall positive attitude toward ACP, acknowledging that these discussions should occur. However, there was a general lack of confidence and sense of reluctance among participants to engage in ACP discussions.\n\n## Conclusion:\nThe lack of statistical difference between the various health professionals suggests that they all faced challenges in participating in ACP discussions. Future research should focus on the influences of cultural factors such as xi\u00e0o on ACP discussion, and develop culturally sensitive strategies to facilitate these discussions in the Chinese community.\n",

Precipitation is a key driver of the productivity of these sensitive ecosystems. This study analyses historical precipitation variability from 1985 to 2014 at El Verde Field Station (EVFS) at 380\u2009m on the north facing slope of the LM. The primary objective of this study is to identify atmospheric states that lead to extreme wet/dry conditions at EVFS. This study also investigates how those wet/dry atmospheric states change over the study period through an epoch approach on annual and seasonal timescales.\n\nSelf\u2010organizing maps (SOMs) are used to produce atmospheric states from ERA\u2010Interim low\u2010tropospheric moisture and circulation variables. These atmospheric states are downscaled to precipitation at the EVFS rain gauge. A probability density function of observed precipitation is calculated for each atmospheric state. Changes in node frequency, which is the number of days mapping to a particular node compared to the total number of days in the temporal period, are used to evaluate changes in wet/dry atmospheric states at EVFS.\n\nResults indicate that low\u2010precipitation days at EVFS are associated with atmospheric states with high 1000\u2013700\u2009hPa bulk wind shear and decreased 700\u2009hPa moisture. Wet days in the study region are associated with moist low\u2010tropospheric environments with low wind shear. Our results indicate an increased frequency of dry season atmospheric states with lower 700\u2009hPa moisture. Over the study period, the dry season has a decrease in median and extreme precipitation during rainy days (days >0\u2009mm). A decrease in early rainfall season median precipitation on rainy days is observed despite an increase in days with measurable precipitation, likely driven by an increase in light rainfall days (<5\u2009mm).\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nHearken is a proprietary news engagement platform growing in popularity. Under the Hearken approach, audience members are invited to participate in the newsmaking process. Hearken strives to assist news organizations in providing local and hyperlocal content that meets audience needs and demands while preserving elements of the journalist\u2019s role as gatekeeper. Hearken has also worked to help news organizations reach underrepresented populations with mixed results per its own anecdotal analyses. This study employs a quantitative content analysis comparing one year\u2019s worth of coverage at four different local NPR affiliates in the United States to provide a breakdown of Hearken content versus traditional reporter-driven content in the following four categories: emphasis on hyperlocal coverage, story topic prevalence within local and hyperlocal coverage, emphasis on coverage of underrepresented communities, and story topic prevalence within coverage of underrepresented communities. Findings reveal listener-driven Hearken content favors hyperlocal news on lifestyle issues while reporter-driven stories emphasize state-level governance and politics as well as local crime. These indicate a stark contrast between the content audiences want and that which journalists tend to report. The nuanced normative implications, possibilities and limitations of Hearken\u2019s model of \u201cdeep participation\u201d are addressed in some detail.\n\nKEYWORDS: Participatory, engagement, hyperlocal, journalism, quantitative content analysis, news in minority and other underserved communities.\n\nDisclosure Statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nORCID\nMark A.

        "abstract": "e17534\n\nBackground: PIM kinases are highly expressed in high risk prostate cancer and are associated with aggressiveness and poor prognosis, presenting a therapeutic target. Methods: We studied PIM inhibition (PIMi) in both hormone-dependent (LNCaP) and -independent (DU145, 22Rv1) prostate cancer cell lines and mouse xenografts. We evaluated PIMi effects via Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and RNAseq of multiple relevant pathways, and performed radiosensitization analysis with colony formation assays. We also investigated xenograft tumor growth with PIMi +/- radiation (RT) or docetaxel. Results: Pretreating the cell lines with PIMi prior to RT caused marked changes in H2AX phosphorylation compared to no PIMi + RT, with most significant alteration in DU145. However, in colony formation assays, 22Rv1 showed greatest radiosensitization with colony survival reduced from 23% to 15% with PIMi. 22Rv1 xenografts were grown in castrated mice, which were randomized to 30 Gy in 15 treatments vs no RT over 3 weeks, -/+ PIMi on RT days. RT + PIMi eliminated gross tumor, compared to an average of 78% and 51% of initial tumor volumes remaining with PIMi alone and RT alone, respectively. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting of harvested tumors showed PIMi altered patterns in proteins involved with hypoxic response (COX-2), cell survival (MDM2), and androgen receptor and suggested interactions between RT and PIMi for both MDM2 and androgen receptor but not COX-2. RNAseq analysis of xenografts showed daily PIMi affected multiple pathways involved in metabolism, growth, and DNA repair. Finally, we tested PIMi -/+ docetaxel in castrated mice with hormone-sensitive (LNCaP) or -resistant (22Rv1) xenografts treated with PIMi -/+ docetaxel. With both xenografts, PIMi + docetaxel reduced tumor size best, with 22Rv1 xenografts most dramatically showing 74% volume reduction from baseline with PIMi + docetaxel compared to 50% and 25% reduction in volumes with PIMi alone and docetaxel alone, respectively. Conclusions: PIMi has multiple pathway effects in prostate cancer. PIMi significantly reduces disease burden, particularly in combination with RT or docetaxel. Our data provide rationale for testing PIMi in clinical trials for prostate cancer.\n",

The CAM provider\u2019s work connects their practice with patient awareness of control over their environment, relationships, and physiology to redefine their pain experience.\n",

Yet, no large-scale analysis exists documenting these storm protection benefits globally. We provide global evidence that mangroves shelter economic activity during tropical cyclone exposure and that this sheltering prevents otherwise permanent losses to economic activity. These findings reveal that even modest mangrove forest coverage has the capacity to provide tremendous storm protection services, which highlights the need for mangrove conservation in many vulnerable coastal communities that have prior received less attention.\n",

The use of smartphones in experimental physics is by now widely accepted and documented. The smart cart in combination with student-owned smartphones and free apps has opened up a new universe of low-cost experiments that have traditionally required cumbersome and expensive equipment. In this paper we demonstrate the simplicity, convenience, and cost saving achieved by replacing a plethora of traditional laboratory sensors, wires, air tracks, and other equipment clutter with the smart cart and the free SPARKvue app for smartphones by carrying out an experiment on damped oscillations.\n",

        "abstract": "In action civics education, an emerging promising practice, students learn civics through taking action on a community issue of interest. We examine the action civics programme Generation Citizen (GC) using quantitative and qualitative student survey data. Our quantitative analyses used a quasi-experimental study design and a multilevel model. Participation in GC was associated with increased action civics knowledge, and there were some variations in impact by programme and classroom characteristics. We also qualitatively analysed students\u2019 short reflections upon programme completion and found that students feel more prepared for civic action. Action civics shows promise for improving student civic outcomes, but more research, including longitudinal follow-up, is needed. Given the variations in impact that we observed, action civics practitioners should carefully choose the implementation setting.\n",
