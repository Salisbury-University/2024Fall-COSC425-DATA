        "abstract": "The use of blood flow restriction (BFR) exercise in athletic and clinical settings has increased in the last five years. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of autoregulated (AR) and non-autoregulated (NAR) BFR biceps curl exercise on arterial stiffness. AR BFR cuffs adjust pressure as the muscle undergoes concentric and eccentric contractions, maintaining a constant pressure in the limb throughout the entire range of motion. NAR BFR training cuffs do not adjust pressure throughout the range of motion thus causing greater pressures in the limb during concentric contraction when the muscle size is enlarged. How this exercise acutely impacts arterial stiffness in upper body exercise is not well understood. METHODS: Following a randomized familiarization period with AR or NAR BFR biceps curl exercise, 33 adults (20 \u00b1 2 years; 11 females) participated in 3 randomized sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no-BFR (no cuffs) separated by 1-week washout periods. Using 20% of the 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) with 2-second concentric/eccentric cadence, participants performed 4 sets of biceps curls to failure. Training limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both BFR sessions. Measurements before and immediately following the training session included blood pressure acquisition, arterial tonometry, and ultrasonography of the carotid artery. Between and within effects of treatment on central systolic blood pressure (cSBP), central diastolic BP (cDBP), central pulse pressure (cPP), central mean arterial pressure (cMAP), pulse wave velocity (PWV), beta-stiffness index (\u03b2-stiff), and arterial compliance (AC) were analyzed with two-way ANOVAs. RESULTS: There were no baseline differences in variable of interest (all p > 0.05). cDBP increased posted exercise in all three groups (AR-BFR mean difference (MD) = 7 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01; NAR-BFR MD = 6 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01; no BFR MD = 5 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01). And there was a non-significant trend in \u03b2-stiff (MD = 1.25 \u00b1 0.46 au, p = 0.07) and AC (MD = -0.3 \u00b1 0.1 mm2/mmHg x 10-1, p = 0.07) with the no BFR treatment. CONCLUSION: The present findings show acute AR-BFR and NAR-BFR bicep training did not impact arterial stiffness.",

        "abstract": "Predation can lead to nonlethal injury as well as mortality in turtles, with many Clemmys guttata (Spotted Turtle) having predator-induced limb and foot amputations. The impact of such injuries on movements of freshwater turtles remains poorly understood. We tracked Spotted Turtles (n = 20) in a single population on the Delmarva Peninsula using radio telemetry for \u223c1 year. Seven turtles had at least 1 limb or foot completely amputated by a predator, and the remaining 13 were uninjured. When comparing movements among turtles, we found no difference in home-range sizes between male (n = 8) and female (n = 7) nor between injured (n = 7) and uninjured (n = 8) Spotted Turtles during their breeding season. However, injured turtles (n = 5) had smaller home ranges (mean \u00b1 SE = 0.26 \u00b1 0.14 ha) than uninjured turtles (n = 12, 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 ha) during the nonbreeding season, when turtles are more terrestrial. Our findings suggest a potential ecological cost of nonlethal injury, as predator effects might extend beyond simple mortality.",

Five domains (challenges, identity, values, relationship, and well-being) and seventeen categories emerged. Participants experienced implicit discrimination and cultural barriers. They identified themselves as Koreans and valued family\u2019s well-being as their priority. They made efforts to find meaning and satisfaction by supporting children to become independent adults. Participants were aware of their traditional parenting styles and the intergenerational cultural gap with their children. As first-generation immigrants, Korean immigrant fathers reported a lack of genuine relationships with both Korean Americans and non-Korean Americans outside of their families. Although participants reported freedom from the pressure caused by interdependent Korean culture, they felt homesickness and emptiness without their own valued life goals.",

All the analytes undergo the same three-step fragmentation in the mass spectrometer. The relative peak intensities from the ions in the fragmentation scheme are plotted as a function of the vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecular ions\u2019 R group. Trends in these plots can be explained using concepts from RRK theory and highlight the \u201cdegrees of freedom effect\u201d in mass spectrometry.

        "abstract": "To investigate the acute effects of 4 sets of autoregulated (AR-BFR) versus non-autoregulated (NAR-BFR) applied pressures during blood flow restriction (BFR) resistance exercise to volitional failure compared with low-load exercise without BFR. A randomized crossover design study was conducted on 32 healthy adults (20.8\u00b12.3 years; 11 females). Outcome measures were as follows: (1) arterial stiffness, (2) peak perceptual responses and likelihood to perform again, and (3) performance. Results: Post-exercise changes in central and brachial diastolic blood pressure were decreased in all groups. Post-exercise supine systolic blood pressure in no-BFR increased (mean difference (MD)=\u22124\u00b11 mmHg, 95% CI (1\u20137), p=0.003, \u03b72=0.13). Total repetitions performed and volume workload were similar between BFR conditions but less than no-BFR. AR-BFR reported significantly higher exertion (MD=\u22120.53\u00b10.2, 95% CI (0.04\u20131.0), p=0.03, \u03b72=0.19) than other conditions, and induced greater discomfort (MD=\u22122.50\u00b10.36, 95% CI (1.63\u20133.37), p<0.001, \u03b72=0.28) than no-BFR. Conclusion: Biceps curl exercise to volitional failure appears to induce negligible arterial stiffness or blood pressure changes regardless of the application of autoregulation, yet autoregulation appears to enhance the perceptual response to BFR exercise compared to NAR-BFR without impacting exercise performance.",

Countries, communities and organizations are realizing that passing profits to workers increases wealth at all levels of society. The benefits, widely known, include personal prosperity, organizational profitability and stability, and a host of economic benefits for communities in which EO companies operate. Selling a company to employees, or starting a cooperative organization containing worker owners, is not without risk. New skills are required for the company to reap the rewards inherent in EO organizations, but the method of creating this change varies significantly from one organization to another. Each is unique, but there are some factors that are common to most EO organizations that have achieved a dynamic organizational culture. These factors, which are critical for success, can be isolated using structured research, organized through a lens of general systems theory and operationalized using principles of Learning Management (LM). The result is an organized knowledge transfer plan that maximizes resources and provides the highest probability of a successful transition to a uniquely profitable EO company.",

To decenter this dominant ethics curriculum, the present phenomenological study explored the moral lived experience of ethics for Korean Buddhist (male and female) monastics (N = 21). Using three-level qualitative coding, data were thematically analyzed. Findings revealed three overarching themes (1) the importance of the sa\u1e45gha and community care, (2) the presence of ethical tensions, and (3) ethics as a practice. Each theme had two sub-themes. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of how these insights from the lived experience of Buddhist ethics may inform and advance social work ethics education beyond the Eurocentric curriculum.",

Born in New Jersey to Irish parents\u2014he is mislabeled as \u201cIrish-born\u201d in some previous studies\u2014Fox followed the trajectory of most foreign-born workers who became anarchists. Contrary to stereotypes, the majority of immigrant anarchists radicalized after their arrival when confronted with the brutalities of American capitalism. It is one of Hall\u2019s arguments that Fox, too, became radicalized after experiencing the assault of a grinding and profoundly unfair economy that left millions of working families voiceless and trapped. Other than a labor activist, Fox was a journalist, printer, and a participant in the anarchist commune at Home, Washington. He witnessed the horror at Haymarket and the subsequent backlash against labor. Like many anarchists, he was involved in several free-speech fights and was indicted himself, leading to a conviction under the anti-anarchist laws enacted after President McKinley\u2019s assassination. His strong support for a more inclusive industrial unionism landed him at the 1905 founding convention of the Industrial Workers of the World.",

        "abstract": "Examples of hybridity in the areas of diplomacy, material culture, economic activities, and religion belied European colonists\u2019 stubborn efforts at claiming and enforcing ideological, physical, and spiritual separateness from Native peoples and cultures in Early America. Tattooing and scalping, two markedly Indigenous practices of body modification, elicited complicated and contradictory reactions from European and early American settler-colonists. Colonial authorities and individuals used elaborate scripting to come to terms with the uncomfortable reality that tattoos and scalps quickly became profoundly cross-cultural practices. Mairin Odle\u2019s sharply written Under the Skin: Tattoos, Scalps, and the Contested Language of Bodies in Early America fills an important gap in the existing literature, in which tattoos and scalps have typically been studied only tangentially to other topics, such as early intercultural encounters or imperial warfare. The author\u2019s critical choice of considering these two practices side by side, despite obvious differences in their purposes and sociopolitical contexts, allows her to develop a powerful argument about the embodied dimensions of settler-colonialism. Under the Skin convincingly shows that the contradictions and ambiguities surrounding colonial descriptions and practices of tattooing and scalping are revealing of the nature and contradictions of settler-colonialism itself. The volume is also notable for its piercing coverage of gendered dimensions of these two practices, despite their overwhelming association in colonial and modern imaginations with masculinity and war.",

In this collaborative autoethnography, six researchers in three mentor-mentee dyads explored what it means to pursue Asian/Asian American feminist mentoring (A/AAFM), through dyadic and group interactive dialogues and collaborative analysis. A/AAFM can be conceptualized as anti-racist praxis, where each mentor attempted to consider mentoring as activism within academia, being grounded in values stemming from A/AA experiences and feminism. Results yielded a model of A/AAFM which emphasizes a convergence of multifaceted racial and cultural identities, feminist values, and activism. Three specific processes emerged: being holistic, relational, and mutual; a focus on community and intergenerational generosity; and intentional flattening of the power hierarchy. Implications for training and activism are discussed.",

We show that applying preference parameter values from experimental settings to market data can significantly understate the role of prospect theory in explaining investor behavior. We find evidence that mutual fund investors exhibit loss aversion and differential attitudes toward risk over losses (risk-seeking) and gains (risk-averse) but no significant probability weighting when evaluating fund performance. Our results apply more strongly to retail funds compared to institutional funds, consistent with the view that prospect theory is more relevant for retail investors. Finally, we show that, for parameter values that best explain fund flows, prospect theory outperforms the global risk aversion framework and widely-used asset pricing models in explaining investors\u2019 responses to fund performance.",

One of the primary goals for the movement is increased source diversity that features more non-official and citizen voices, like those often used in other forms of alternative media. This study examined the types of sources journalists included in 555 text-based solutions journalism articles from the U.S., Europe, and Africa collected from the Solutions Journalism Network. The results indicate solutions stories are meeting the goals set forth by proponents of the movement, as they most frequently include nonprofits/groups and unaffiliated citizens. Solutions stories in American publications contained significantly more non-official sources than did their European and African counterparts, though these sources still comprised the majority of those used across all three continents. However, solutions stories included in the study contained fewer total sources than traditional news articles and still featured government and business sources regularly. This finding suggests solutions journalism practitioners may still have work to do to increase their use and variety of sources.",

Participants A convenience sample of 20 undergraduate students (age 20.6\u00b12.2 years) at a private liberal arts university in Southern California who recently completed a general education health and wellness course. Method Five focus group sessions were conducted to explore perceptions of wellness among undergraduate college students. Data was analyzed, themed, and coded. Results A thematic analysis of the descriptions of wellness revealed 2 higher-ordered themes as whole-person and wellbeing, and 3 lower-ordered themes of balance, interconnectedness, and personalized in relation to participants\u2019 understanding of wellness. Conclusions The importance of balance between wellness dimensions and the acknowledgment of the interconnectedness of wellness dimensions are related to quality of life and life satisfaction. A deeper insight is needed to better understand the perceptions of wellness in this population to provide more effective interventions. This can be achieved through the development of enhanced pedagogy, which may improve student health.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of limb occlusion pressure (LOP) position on exercise performance, cardiovascular responses, and perceptual experiences during seated bilateral leg extensions with and without blood flow restriction (BFR). Thirty resistance-trained males (age: 22\u00b12 years; weight: 74.4\u00b113.6 kg; height: 177.4\u00b16.4 cm; BMI: 23.5\u00b13.3 kg/m2) participated. Each performed exercise to failure (4 sets, 30% 1RM, 1 min rest) in three conditions: Supine LOP-BFR, Seated LOP-BFR, and no-BFR. BFR was applied at 60% LOP. Significant interaction effects were found for RPE (p = 0.021, d = 0.76), RPD (p < 0.01, d = 1.72), and DOMS (p < 0.01, d = 2.28). Statistically significant fewer repetitions were completed in Supine LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.5), Seated LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 1.0), and Seated LOP-BFR vs. Supine LOP-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.6). RPE was higher in Seated LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.52). RPD was higher in Supine LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.62) and Seated LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 1.25). DOMS was higher in Supine LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.77) and Seated LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 3.52). Seated LOP-BFR increased perceptual demands and reduced repetitions compared to Supine LOP-BFR. Both LOP-BFR conditions reduced repetitions compared to no-BFR without affecting cardiovascular measures.",
