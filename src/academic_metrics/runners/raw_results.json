[{"abstract": "The use of blood flow restriction (BFR) exercise in athletic and clinical settings has increased in the last five years. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of autoregulated (AR) and non-autoregulated (NAR) BFR biceps curl exercise on arterial stiffness. AR BFR cuffs adjust pressure as the muscle undergoes concentric and eccentric contractions, maintaining a constant pressure in the limb throughout the entire range of motion. NAR BFR training cuffs do not adjust pressure throughout the range of motion thus causing greater pressures in the limb during concentric contraction when the muscle size is enlarged. How this exercise acutely impacts arterial stiffness in upper body exercise is not well understood. METHODS: Following a randomized familiarization period with AR or NAR BFR biceps curl exercise, 33 adults (20 \u00b1 2 years; 11 females) participated in 3 randomized sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no-BFR (no cuffs) separated by 1-week washout periods. Using 20% of the 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) with 2-second concentric/eccentric cadence, participants performed 4 sets of biceps curls to failure. Training limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both BFR sessions. Measurements before and immediately following the training session included blood pressure acquisition, arterial tonometry, and ultrasonography of the carotid artery. Between and within effects of treatment on central systolic blood pressure (cSBP), central diastolic BP (cDBP), central pulse pressure (cPP), central mean arterial pressure (cMAP), pulse wave velocity (PWV), beta-stiffness index (\u03b2-stiff), and arterial compliance (AC) were analyzed with two-way ANOVAs. RESULTS: There were no baseline differences in variable of interest (all p > 0.05). cDBP increased posted exercise in all three groups (AR-BFR mean difference (MD) = 7 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01; NAR-BFR MD = 6 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01; no BFR MD = 5 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01). And there was a non-significant trend in \u03b2-stiff (MD = 1.25 \u00b1 0.46 au, p = 0.07) and AC (MD = -0.3 \u00b1 0.1 mm2/mmHg x 10-1, p = 0.07) with the no BFR treatment. CONCLUSION: The present findings show acute AR-BFR and NAR-BFR bicep training did not impact arterial stiffness.", "extra_context": {"authors": ["Ruffhead, Campbell", "Rolnick, Nicholas", "Taylor, Susannah", "Marquette, Lisa", "Fedorko, Brent", "Walters, Jessica", "Werner, Tim"], "date": "2024-01-01", "keywords": ["blood flow restriction", "arterial stiffness", "exercise"], "journal": "Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise", "volume": "56", "issue": "10S", "pages": "44", "doi": "10.1249/01.mss.0001052868.70990.0c"}}, {"abstract": "", "extra_context": {"authors": ["Zupnik, Sean", "Moghaddam, Masoud", "Rolnick, Nicholas", "Marquette, Lisa", "Taylor, Susannah", "Walters, Jessica", "Fedorko, Brent", "Werner, Tim"], "publication_date": "October 2024", "journal": "Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise", "volume": "56", "issue": "10S", "doi": "10.1249/01.mss.0001060920.34828.c8", "keywords": ["Blood Flow Restriction", "Exercise Training", "Subjective Assessments"]}}, {"abstract": "Predation can lead to nonlethal injury as well as mortality in turtles, with many Clemmys guttata (Spotted Turtle) having predator-induced limb and foot amputations. The impact of such injuries on movements of freshwater turtles remains poorly understood. We tracked Spotted Turtles (n = 20) in a single population on the Delmarva Peninsula using radio telemetry for \u223c1 year. Seven turtles had at least 1 limb or foot completely amputated by a predator, and the remaining 13 were uninjured. When comparing movements among turtles, we found no difference in home-range sizes between male (n = 8) and female (n = 7) nor between injured (n = 7) and uninjured (n = 8) Spotted Turtles during their breeding season. However, injured turtles (n = 5) had smaller home ranges (mean \u00b1 SE = 0.26 \u00b1 0.14 ha) than uninjured turtles (n = 12, 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 ha) during the nonbreeding season, when turtles are more terrestrial. Our findings suggest a potential ecological cost of nonlethal injury, as predator effects might extend beyond simple mortality.", "extra_context": {"keywords": [], "authors": ["Karsin M.
