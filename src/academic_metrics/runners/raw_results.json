[{"abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in living organisms can generate oxidative stress, which contributes to cell damage associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Studying responses to oxidative stress in model organisms, like the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, may provide insight into basic underlying cellular mechanisms shared with humans. MRCK-1 (myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42 binding kinase), a highly conserved intracellular kinase, is activated by the G-protein, Cdc42, which contains a redox sensitive motif. Previous studies have shown that MRCK-1 regulates cell polarity and cytoskeleton reorganization, particularly during cell division and in response to cellular damage. To determine if MRCK-1 plays a role in other cellular defense responses, we are testing if RNA interference (RNAi) of mrck-1 results in the production of more ROS under stressed conditions. The cell permeable fluorescent ROS indicator, carboxymethyl dichlorodihydrofluorescein derivative, CM-H2DCFDA, shows significantly increased fluorescence in hydrogen peroxide-treated worms when quantified using the SpectraMax microplate reader. Oxidative stress conditions were induced with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence of CM-H2DCFDA, and fluorescence was measured over a period of 20 hours. Measuring the fluorescence of worms exposed to dsRNA from two independent mrck-1 RNAi constructs, mrck-m and mrck-s, enables the quantification of ROS levels when MRCK-1 function is decreased. Exploring the levels of ROS in RNAi-treated C. elegans may give further insight into the cellular role of MRCK-1 both in worms and in humans.\nSupport or Funding Information: Special acknowledgments to the Salisbury University Department of Biological Sciences, the Henson Undergraduate Research Award, and the National Science Foundation MRI Acquisition Award DBI-1337534 for support.", "extra_context": {"keywords": ["Reactive oxygen species", "oxidative stress", "neurodegenerative diseases", "C. elegans", "MRCK-1", "RNA interference", "hydrogen peroxide"], "authors": ["Callista Brown", "Ruth Heying", "Matthew Russo", "Stephen Rigoulot", "Patti Erickson"], "date": "03 October 2018", "journal": "The FASEB Journal", "volume": "31", "issue": "S1", "pages": "770.10-770.10", "funding_acknowledgment": "Salisbury University Department of Biological Sciences, Henson Undergraduate Research Award, National Science Foundation MRI Acquisition Award DBI-1337534"}}, {"abstract": "Inspired by spontaneously fermented beers, such as Belgian Lambic beers, American breweries have moved beyond using exclusively domesticated strains of the beer-making yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to experimenting with a variety of different yeast species to produce unique flavors and aromas. The so-called \u201cfunky,\u201d \u201cwild,\u201d and \u201csour,\u201d beers are produced using uncommon microorganisms either during or after the primary ferment. The goal of our research is to isolate, identify, and characterize wild yeasts from the local environment and to make them available to both commercial and craft brewers for making novel beers. The use of locally-sourced yeasts could also be used by commercial brewers as a marketing angle, as is often done with local hops, grains, or water. As a source of wild yeasts, we obtained various wild and cultivated fruits growing in rural Maryland and a sample of Belgium-style ale being aged in used oak wine barrels at Evolution Craft Brewing Company (Salisbury, MD). Yeast colonies were isolated using yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD) agar plates containing antibiotics and identified by colony morphology as well as PCR amplification and sequencing of the 5.8S rRNA genes. The identified yeasts belong to Saccharomyces, Pichia, Candida, Fusarium, Torulaspora, and, most interestingly, Brettanomyces genera. The Brettanomyces yeast, which was isolated from the wine barrel ale, is normally considered a wine spoilage yeast but increasingly is being employed to create \u201cfunky\u201d and sour flavors in beer. The growth and fermentation abilities of eight different yeast isolates were analyzed for growth in different liquid medias (YPD, hopped barley-malt extract, and merlot grape juice) using 96-well plates and spectroscopy. Growth rates were calculated using a modified grofit package in RStudio. Ethanol production will be determined using a colorimetric assay. Thus far, the most compelling discovery is a wild strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that grows comparable to a commercially-available brewing yeast and produces pleasant, fruity aromas when fermenting barley malt extract. The complete characterization of these wild yeasts will be reported in order to identify novel wild yeasts that can be domesticated for local craft brewers.

Eastern Red-backed Salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, are often used as indicators of habitat quality in eastern North American forests. Most of the research concerning growth in this species has focused on the influence of body size, rather than on other external or temporal factors that might affect growth. We performed a mark\u2013recapture study spanning multiple years and seasons to compare the growth of individuals of P. cinereus across temporally variable environmental conditions. Unsurprisingly, the most significant factor affecting growth was body size. Growth also varied seasonally and annually, with greater growth of salamanders during a mild winter and more growth in 2014 than 2013. Sex-age class did interact with yearly fluctuations as evidenced by juveniles, but not adults, having reduced growth in 2014. However, color morph did not have an effect on growth. We concluded that fluctuating environmental conditions, as well as body size, exerted effects on the salamanders' growth. This study adds to our understanding of the factors affecting growth in terrestrial salamanders and provides context for past and future studies of body size and abundance in this ecologically important species.", "extra_context": {"keywords": ["body size", "Caudata", "color morph", "mark\u2013recapture", "seasons", "Plethodon cinereus"], "authors": ["Joshua R.
