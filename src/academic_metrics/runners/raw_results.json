[{"abstract": "Cattle treated with chemicals to control parasites can fecally excrete residues that have the potential to adversely affect local assemblages of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). Using 200-m transects and dung-baited pitfall traps, we compared the dung beetle communities on 19 cattle farms in Maryland, USA where pests and/or parasites were controlled with chemicals (CU, n = 9 farms) or where no chemicals were used (NCU, n = 10 farms). Traps were baited once a month with fresh cattle dung from each location. We collected a total of 31 species comprising 12,380 dung beetle specimens. The five most abundant species, Onthophagus taurus (Schreber), Onthophagus pennsylvanicus Harold, Onthophagus hecate (Panzer), Blackburneus stercorosus (Melsheimer), and Labarrus pseudolividus (Balthasar), accounted for 85% of the total individuals sampled. No difference was found when comparing total abundances of dung beetles sampled from NCU and CU farms. There was, however, a consistent significant effect of month across multiple dominant species. Using Random Forests analyses, we determined site location, soil type, and chemical lethality as additional important predictor variables affecting dung beetle abundances on Maryland farms. Present-day management practices implement a broad spectrum of chemical usage. Our work examines this variability to facilitate the understanding of factors currently affecting the biodiversity and abundance of beneficial dung beetles.

Experiencing discrimination can cause stress and negative mental health outcomes. However, Muslim identity can also be a source of coping, and the Muslim community can be a source of support in the face of Islamophobia. We hypothesized that openness about identity within the Muslim community may differ based on gender and that experiences of discrimination would be associated with a desire to hide one\u2019s Muslim identity in public for women but not for men. Seventy-three Muslim college students were recruited through snowball sampling in a cross-sectional survey in North America. Mean differences and correlational patterns were compared between women (n = 35) and men (n = 30). Correlational and regression analyses revealed that for women but not men, discrimination was correlated with hiding one\u2019s Muslim identity in public. Microaggressions and offence at Trump\u2019s proposed travel ban were related to openness with other Muslims for women only. Women were more offended than men by Trump\u2019s statement but only after President Trump took office. Intersectionality needs to be unpacked to better understand the multidimensional nature of gendered Islamophobia and racist policy actions.\n\nKEYWORDS: Gendered Islamophobia, Muslim women, religious identity, intersectionality, travel ban\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nNotes\n1.

Cataloging carries power, so ethical decision-making is crucial. Because cataloging requires decision-making in areas that differ from other library work, cataloging ethics are a distinct subset of library ethics. Cataloging ethics draw on the primary values of serving the needs of users and providing access to materials. Cataloging ethics are not new, but they have received increased attention since the 1970s. Major current issues in cataloging ethics include the creation of a code of ethics; ongoing debate on the appropriate role of neutrality in cataloging misleading materials and in subject heading lists and classification schemes; how and to what degree considerations of privacy and self-determination should shape authority work; and whether or not our current cataloging codes are sufficiently user-focused.\n\n**Keywords:** Cataloging ethics, radical cataloging, critical cataloging, cataloging values, neutrality, ethical issues\n\n**Acknowledgements**\nThe author would like to thank Violet Fox, Nicole Kulp, and Audrey Schadt for their feedback on an early draft of this article. The author would also like to thank the anonymous peer reviewers and Gretchen Hoffman and Karen Snow for their feedback on a later draft.\n\n**Notes on contributor**\nJennifer M. Martin is the Cataloging and Metadata Services Librarian at Salisbury University. Her primary job responsibilities include cataloging materials for the Ernie Bond Curriculum Resource Center and the Nabb Research Center for Delmarva History and Culture; reviewing metadata in SOAR@SU, the university\u2019s institutional repository; managing WorldCat Discovery, the university\u2019s discovery layer and knowledge base; and coordinating collection development training for the SU Libraries.\n\n**Notes**\n1. Cataloger\u2019s judgment most frequently is applied in situations where cataloging rules are flexible or imprecise.

The current study examined self-esteem based on the two verbal coercion items included in the latest version of the most popular measure of sexual victimization experience, the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization (SES-SFV; Koss et al., 2007). One item includes verbal tactics categorized as \u201cthreat\u201d and the other item includes verbal tactics categorized as \u201ccriticism.\u201d Undergraduate women (n = 479) completed the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the SES-SFV. Results showed that women who experienced criticism reported lower self-esteem than those who did not experience criticism. However, threat experience was not significantly related to women\u2019s self-esteem. Findings support Koss et al.\u2019s suggestion that criticism tactics are more negative than threat tactics, and imply that self-esteem may be negatively associated with some sexually coercive verbal tactics but not associated with others. Future researchers should pay careful attention to operational definitions of verbal coercion.\n\n**Get full access to this article**  \n**References**  \n- Bekele A. B., van Aken M. A., Dubas J. S.

Some methods, such as the use of beehives, chili fences and electric fences, seem to reduce, but not eliminate, human/elephant conflict and property loss (Karidozo et al., 2006). However, these methods require permanent infrastructure and are difficult to deploy quickly. As with most human/wildlife conflict, it is individual elephants, not the species as a whole, that are responsible for this conflict. Elephants have large home ranges, and these individuals can shift the locus of their activity from one site to another. When conflict occurs, the most common solution is to kill the elephant (Karidozo & Osborn, 2015), even though both species of African (Loxodonta africana) and Asian (Elephas maximus) elephants are currently endangered. Here we present a case study of an alternate method to killing, disruptive darting, that can be deployed quickly on elephants visiting a location where they are not desired, with obvious ethical and conservation benefits.\n\nThe subject of this study is a male elephant ~35 years old, who carries a GPS collar as part of a larger study. His home range includes the town of Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, a popular tourist destination. Located within Victoria Falls National Park, the town\u2019s tourism areas and residential properties connect directly to the surrounding wildlife areas. Therefore, it is common to observe wildlife traveling close to humans and their properties \u2013 sometimes even walking downtown during the daylight.\n\nIn July 2018, our subject began to feed on trees near the Victoria Falls Baobab Elementary School, which caused concerns when children were playing in the school yard. The school contacted the Zimbabwe Parks & Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks), requesting he be \u2018removed\u2019 from their property. In an effort to keep the bull alive, and the children safe, ZimParks allowed us to anesthetize the animal and apply concentrated chili wax (>150000 Scoville units) on sensitive parts of his body (avoiding the eyes). Based on human reactions to the wax, this would have caused non-lethal, temporary but intense discomfort, lasting 45\u201390 minutes. The bull approached within 375 meters of the school buildings on three consecutive days immediately before the application of the wax, spending most of each day there. After application he immediately left and stayed away from the area around the school for 1 year and 2 months, never entering the school yard nor approaching closer than 375 meters. After this period of complete avoidance, he came within 375 meters of the school only three times, in September and October 2020. These visits were always during the night when no humans were present. This nocturnal behavior is consistent with other studies about elephants avoiding humans. In the 2 years after the mitigation, he has yet to approach within 250 meters of the school.\n\nHowever, while he largely avoided the location of the mitigation event for over 2 years, and still seems to be avoiding humans in that area by visiting only at night, he did not generalize this avoidance to all humans, since he still visited other parts of the town, when people were present, during this period.\n\nThus, this disruptive darting, while having notable implementation costs in terms of personnel and materials, produced a long-term effect that benefits the conservation of elephants and reduces human\u2013elephant conflict. This may make the costs comparable to installing and maintaining infrastructure solutions like bee hives or fencing over a comparable period. Disruptive darting can be deployed quickly, and it keeps alive endangered elephants that would otherwise be killed. There is also the potential, yet to be explored, that an elephant initially treated with disruptive darting may associate the smell of capsicum with the experience, and thus be deterred by less invasive and less expensive mitigation methods, such as burning chili-infused dung bricks.\n\nIn addition to its practical benefits, the method described here has implications for the study of the cognitive behavior of elephants. Elephants are known to have excellent spatial memory and the ability to discriminate between humans whom they perceive as a threat and those whom they perceive as safe. Our study is consistent with these findings, in that the elephant seemed to associate the unpleasant event with a specific location, and perhaps with people at that location, rather than people in general. Further investigation of this technique may provide insight into the cognitive processes of an intelligent non-human animal.\n\nAcknowledgment\nWe thank the Zimbabwe Parks & Wildlife Management Authority for making this study possible.", "extra_context": {"authors": ["W.

The present study examined the unique relation of each humor style with psychological well-being with a focus on understanding mechanisms of adjustment under highly stressful conditions. Ninety-nine parents of children with disabilities were surveyed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in March 2020, and 79 parents completed follow-up surveys in July 2020. As predicted, at T1, self-enhancing humor was associated with less psychological distress and greater family satisfaction, self-defeating humor was associated with greater distress, and aggressive humor was associated with lower family satisfaction. Moreover, affiliative humor predicted decreased psychological distress over time, whereas self-defeating humor predicted increased psychological distress and decreased family satisfaction over time. Relations were largely mediated by caregiver positive reappraisal, family efforts to reframe daily disability-related challenges, and negative social interactions. Future research should further examine the influence of caregiver humor styles on family dynamics, family reframing norms, and caregiving efficacy.\n\n## Introduction\nResearch on Martin et al.\u2019s (2003) adaptive and maladaptive humor styles has burgeoned in recent years. Adaptive styles use positive, benign humor to connect with others by means of funny comments or anecdotes (affiliative humor), or to bolster the self by noting amusing or ironic aspects of daily events (self-enhancing humor). By contrast, maladaptive styles use injurious or sarcastic humor to insult others and thereby elevate the self (aggressive humor) or to disparage the self as a means of connecting with or gaining attention from others (self-defeating humor; see Martin (2007), for a review). Recent work has focused on the role of humor styles in coping with real-life stressors. Such work is essential to the conceptualization of these constructs: If we are to continue labeling humor styles as \u201cadaptive\u201d and \u201cmaladaptive,\u201d we must examine how these concepts operate under conditions that require some sort of adaptation.\n\nEmerging evidence suggests that the adaptive humor styles do indeed facilitate adjustment to stressors outside of the laboratory, including coping with police work (Kerkkanen et al., 2004), university academics (Fritz, 2020a), chronic pain (Ramirez-Meastra et al., 2020), infertility (Ostovar et al., 2020), and terrorist attacks (Fritz et al., 2017). By contrast, the maladaptive humor styles interfere with adjustment to these same stressors, with a particularly strong pattern of evidence demonstrating that self-defeating humor predicts worse psychological and physical adaptation to stressors over time (Fritz, 2020b; Schneider et al., 2018).\n\nParents of children with disabilities live under chronically stressful conditions (Isa et al., 2016; Neely-Barnes & Dia, 2008). A recent review of the literature on cerebral palsy and family stress concluded that parents of children with disabilities report greater stress and worse mental and physical health than parents of typically developing children (Fritz & Sewell-Roberts, 2018). A variety of social, emotional, and health behavior factors explain this disparity in well-being. However, it is important to note that not all parents of children with disabilities fare poorly: Considerable variability in well-being exists even among those parenting children with severe disabilities. Parent financial resources, social support, self-efficacy, and coping strategies all help to explain why some parent-caregivers thrive while others struggle (Fritz & Sewell-Roberts, 2018).\n\nThree studies to date have examined the coping strategy of humor use among parents of children with disabilities and found that the positive aspects of humor use are linked with enhanced caregiver well-being and family functioning (Fritz, 2020b; Rieger & McGrail, 2013, 2015). The present study aims to extend prior work by examining the role of humor styles in adapting to a potentially more stressful situation than those of past studies: Caregiving for a child with a disability during a global pandemic.\n\n## Goals\nTo summarize, the goals of the present study were (1) to replicate the relations of humor styles with well-being among individuals coping with significant chronic stress\u2014the parents of children with disabilities during a global pandemic, (2) to extend past work on the relation of humor styles with well-being among parent-caregivers by controlling for shared variance among humor styles and by obtaining a larger T2 sample, (3) to extend prior work by examining the effects of humor styles on family satisfaction, (4) to replicate past research showing that caregivers\u2019 positive reappraisal mediates relations of humor styles with psychological well-being and to extend this concept to two new family-level reappraisal coping constructs created for this study, positive reframing of daily disability-related challenges and positive reframing of disability-related emergencies, and (5) to replicate past research showing that social interactions mediate relations of humor styles with well-being.\n\n## Keywords\nCaregiving, disability, parents of children with disabilities, humor styles, reframing, cognitive reappraisal, COVID-19\n\n## Author\nHeidi L.

The current study contributes to the literature by examining body-esteem based on type of sexual victimization experience (i.e., none, sexual contact, attempted sexual coercion, sexual coercion, attempted rape, rape). Participants included undergraduate women (n = 750) who completed the Body-Esteem Scale (Franzoi & Shields, 1984) and the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization (Koss et al., 2007), and had either no history of sexual victimization experience or experience within the past year. Women with no sexual victimization experience did not differ from women with sexual contact experience, but both groups reported higher body-esteem than women with coercion, attempted coercion, and rape experience. These three latter groups did not differ from one another, but each reported lower body-esteem than women with attempted rape experience, who reported higher body-esteem than those with no experience. Findings are preliminary but suggest that body-esteem may be negatively associated with some types of sexual victimization experience (attempted and completed coercion, rape), but not others (sexual contact, attempted rape), and escaping rape may increase positive feelings toward one\u2019s body.\n\n#### Keywords\n- body-esteem\n- type\n- sexual victimization\n- rape\n- coercion\n- contact\n\n#### References\n- Cecil H., Matson S.

In this essay, it is argued that statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT) should be considered an important component of their preparation as well. Health care professionals often must help others understand the statistical basis for recommendations they make. A COVID-19 press briefing is used to illustrate the need for SKT when making high-stakes recommendations related to public health. It is conjectured that efforts to educate the public during the press briefing would have been enhanced if the presenters had deeper knowledge of the general public\u2019s common statistical thinking patterns, the typical statistics curriculum experienced by members of their audience, and contemporary tools for teaching statistics. The importance of such knowledge to support smaller-scale individual interactions is also discussed. A call for SKT-centered partnerships between educational researchers and medical researchers is made; such partnerships could be mutually beneficial to the development of both fields and to society at large.\n\nKeywords: Dynamic statistics software, Medical research, Pedagogical content knowledge, Statistical knowledge for teaching, Statistical thinking\n\nThis article is part of the following collections: Teaching Data Science and Statistics and the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\n1. Introduction\nIt is widely accepted that statistics is an important part of the knowledge base for those in the health professions (e.g., World Federation for Medical Education, 2015; Oster and Enders, 2018). Statistical knowledge allows health care professionals to understand research literature and conduct their own studies. Although the specific statistical concepts to be addressed and appropriate pedagogical approaches are at times under-specified in standards for medical education (Hayat, 2014), few would argue against requiring those entering the health professions to study statistics.\n\nThis essay focuses on a different type of knowledge that health care professionals should have: statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT). SKT is not equivalent to statistical knowledge. Concisely stated, SKT is knowledge that allows one to make statistics comprehensible to others (Groth, 2013). Health care professionals need to help people make evidence-based decisions about courses of action for preserving and improving their well-being (Nelson et al., 2002), though their ability and confidence to do so are sometimes questionable (Rao, 2008). Doctors and nurses frequently make data-based recommendations during private interactions with individuals; government officials charged with preserving public health are sometimes called upon to do so on a large scale in public. This educational responsibility was especially visible during the COVID-19 pandemic. This essay argues that having statistical knowledge alone is not sufficient to teach the public about the evidential basis for recommended health practices. It is also important to have knowledge of effective teaching practices that account for how people generally interpret statistics.\n\nThe essay begins with a brief description of the nature of SKT and how it overlaps, with yet differs from, from statistical and mathematical knowledge. Then, the notion of SKT is used to reflect upon a widely viewed press briefing in which two prominent health care professionals in the United States tried to explain the statistical basis for COVID-19 mitigation measures and treatments at a critical point in the pandemic timeline. The major statistical concepts they dealt with during the press briefing are discussed, and conjectures about how their attempt to educate the public may have been enhanced by deeper SKT are made. Broader implications about the need for SKT among health care professionals around the world and strategies for meeting the need are then considered.\n\n2. The Nature of SKT\nSKT encompasses more than just statistics subject matter knowledge; it also includes pedagogical content knowledge (Groth, 2013). Shulman (1987) characterized pedagogical content knowledge as the \u201cspecial amalgam of content and pedagogy that is uniquely the province of teachers, their own special form of professional understanding\u201d (p. 8). Having subject matter expertise alone does not make one an effective teacher; good statisticians may or may not have pedagogical skill. Pedagogical content knowledge has been studied extensively within the context of teachers in conventional classroom settings (Depaepe, Verschaffel, and Kelchtermans, 2013); the present article extends the consideration of pedagogical content knowledge to health care professionals charged with making evidence-based recommendations to the public.\n\nHill, Ball, and Schilling (2008) discussed three essential components of pedagogical content knowledge: knowledge of content and students, knowledge of content and teaching, and curriculum knowledge. These three components have been used widely in research on SKT (Langrall et al., 2017). Knowledge of content and students involves knowing how individuals commonly understand, and misunderstand, statistics content. Such knowledge supports knowledge of content and teaching, which allows for the selection of pedagogical strategies that leverage existing student understandings and address their common misunderstandings. A third component of pedagogical content knowledge, curriculum knowledge, provides understanding of the broad frameworks and learning progressions that generally undergird the teaching of statistics.\n\nAlong with being more than just statistical subject matter knowledge, SKT is also more than just mathematical knowledge. Undoubtedly, a great deal of mathematical knowledge is needed to teach statistics. However, considerable amounts of nonmathematical knowledge are needed as well. For example, those who teach statistics must know how to distinguish between deterministic and stochastic questions, construct surveys, design studies, and interpret results in context (Groth, 2007). Mathematical knowledge is necessary, but not sufficient, for such tasks. Many statistical tasks are highly context-dependent and not reducible to deterministic algorithms and conclusions. At its core, statistics is the study of variation and uncertainty. This stands in contrast to mathematics, in which deductive reasoning can lead to definitive proofs. Mathematical tools are helpful for statistical tasks, yet we cannot expect them to produce conclusions as certain as those of mathematical proofs in most statistical contexts. Reconciling certainty in mathematics with uncertainty in statistics is a nontrivial task. Knowing how to help the public distinguish between statistical and mathematical conclusions during a time of anxiety such as the COVID-19 pandemic is especially challenging, as people naturally seek unequivocal answers to questions that cannot be answered with complete certainty.\n\n3. SKT in the Context of a COVID-19 Press Briefing\nIn the United States, at the outset of the pandemic, Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci were charged with explaining the basis for government-led COVID-19 mitigation and efforts to develop treatments and vaccines. On March 31, 2020, the two doctors employed statistical tools and arguments during a press briefing to do so. The press briefing came at a critical time, as the United States had recorded just a small percentage of its eventual deaths from the virus (approximately 4000 of what would grow to be over 250,000), and audiences for the daily briefings from the White House were averaging approximately 8 million viewers (Grynbaum, 2020). A primary goal of the briefing was to argue in favor of extending existing mitigation measures, which included stay-at-home orders, business closures, and maintaining social distance in public. Video of the press briefing was posted online afterward (e.g., https://www.c-span.org/video/?470841-1/white-house-warns-upcoming-painful-weeks&live=). Quotes in this essay were drawn from the government video transcript (available from https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-15/). The statistical subject matter of the press briefing included models, disaggregation of data, and experimental study design. Next, a summary of how Drs. Birx and Fauci dealt with each of these statistical ideas during the press briefing is given, followed by conjectures about how deeper SKT related to the three main statistical ideas may have enhanced their efforts to teach the public.\n\n3.1 Press Briefing Introductory Presentation Summary\nDr. Birx began her portion of the press briefing by projecting the slide shown in Figure 1. Two curves appeared on the slide: one to illustrate the spread of COVID-19 without mitigation measures, and another to illustrate its spread with mitigation measures fully in place. She explained that the curves were based on modeling done by \u201cfive or six international and domestic modelers from Harvard, from Columbia, from Northeastern, from Imperial who helped us tremendously.\u201d In reference to the curve on the far left in Figure 1, Dr. Birx stated, \u201cIn their estimates, they had between 1.5 million and 2.2 million people in the United States succumbing to this virus without mitigation.\u201d She explained that the curve on the far right showed projected deaths if mitigation measures such as social distancing and hand-washing were fully implemented, saying, \u201cwhat an extraordinary thing this could be if every American followed these, and it takes us to that stippled mountain that\u2019s much lower\u2014a hill, actually\u2014down to 100,000 to 200,000 deaths, which is still way too much.\u201d\n\nNext, Dr. Birx projected the slide shown in Figure 2 and said it was from the work of a modeler at the University of Washington who took hospital need data from around the world into account. She explained that the graph depicted what would be possible with full implementation of the government\u2019s mitigation measures, and that the model was being continuously updated each day by using new data. Dr. Birx further argued for full implementation of the recommended mitigation measures by showing a third slide with a graph (Figure 3). She used the third slide to argue that states with strong mitigation measures in place were more successful containing the disease, stating,\n\nIt was just a month ago when they started to have the issues in Washington State, but they brought together their communities and their health providers, and they put in strong mitigation methods and testing. And you can see what the result in Washington State and California is. But without the continuation for the next 30 days, anything could change.\n\nShe then displayed the slide shown in Figure 4 with data from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The slide illustrated the scope of the problem in New York and New Jersey relative to other areas. Dr. Birx showed these data to encourage community-by-community mitigation to prevent spikes in cases in other states.\n\nDr. Birx ended the formal presentation portion of the press briefing by showing and discussing the slide in Figure 5. It was meant to further support her contention that mitigation measures should be fully implemented. Dr. Birx stated,\n\nSo this is what gives us a lot of hope. This is the case finding in Italy. And you can see that they\u2019re beginning to turn the corner in new cases. They\u2019re entering their fourth week of full mitigation and showing what is possible when we work together as a community, as a country, to change the course of this pandemic together.\n\nDr. Birx closed her portion of the presentation by asking the audience to continue existing mitigation measures for an additional 30 days. Dr. Fauci then came to the microphone to support her request. He warned the audience that the effects of mitigation might not be apparent immediately, and to not be discouraged if cases continued to rise in the short term. He finished his formal comments by stating the following about the government\u2019s recommended mitigation measures:\n\nIt\u2019s inconvenient from a societal standpoint, from an economic standpoint to go through this, but this is going to be the answer to our problems. So let\u2019s all pull together and make sure, as we look forward to the next 30 days, we do it with all the intensity and force that we can.\n\nAfter the formal presentation portion of the press briefing, Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci responded to questions from reporters in attendance. Several questions and responses are incorporated in the next three subsections, because they help reveal how statistical ideas and claims included in the formal presentation portion of the press briefing were interpreted by the audience.\n\n3.2 SKT and Statistical Models\nDuring the question-and-answer portion of the press briefing, reporters asked about the model projections Dr. Birx had provided (Figure 1). One reporter began this line of questioning by asking, \u201cJust to be clear, what is the projected death toll, should the people be reasonably good at following these mitigation measures?\u201d Dr. Birx responded,\n\nSo, of course, this is a projection, and it\u2019s a projection based on using very much what\u2019s happened in Italy and then looking at all the models. And so, as you saw on that slide, that was our real number\u2014that 100,000 to 200,000. And we think that that is the range. We really believe and hope every day that we can do a lot better than that\u2014because that\u2019s not assuming 100 percent of every American does everything that they\u2019re supposed to be doing. But I think that\u2019s possible.\n\nDr. Fauci added, \u201cThe modeling that Dr. Birx showed predicts that number that you saw\u2014we don\u2019t accept that number that that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be; we\u2019re going to be doing everything we can to get it even significantly below that.\u201d Later in the press briefing, questions about how model outputs would change in response to different inputs reemerged. Additional reporter questions of this type included:\n\n- What do the models suggest is on the low end if you have full mitigation?\n- If 100,000 is the number with full mitigation, how do you push it lower?\n- If we had started these practices sooner, could these models be different right now?\n\nThe persistence of these types of questions throughout the press briefing suggests that a different strategy for teaching the relationship between model inputs and outputs would have been desirable. One strategy for teaching the relationship between model inputs and outputs would be to use dynamic, rather than static, graphical representations during the briefing. The emergence of dynamic representations can be considered one of the major developments in statistics pedagogy over the past two decades and an important part of the knowledge base for teaching the subject (Lee and Hollebrands, 2011). Rather than limiting graphical representations to the extreme cases of no mitigation and full mitigation (as in Figure 1), a dynamic graph would allow one to see how varying degrees of mitigation might change outcomes. Sliders assigned to parameters could be introduced to allow one to adjust inputs and observe the results. Users of the dynamic representation could then explore answers to questions like those that reporters posed about the impact of timing and extent of mitigation rather than having to rely upon just the two extreme ends of a continuum represented in static graphs (Figure 1). Knowing the educational possibilities of dynamic representations falls within the knowledge of content and teaching aspect of SKT.\n\nAs individuals interact with statistical models, it is important for them to know that such models are subject to change based on new data, conditions, and assumptions. Dr. Fauci acknowledged this during the press briefing, stating, \u201cI know my modeling colleagues are going to not be happy with me, but models are as good as the assumptions you put into them, and as we get more data, then you put it in and that might change.\u201d Although the comment rightly acknowledges degrees of uncertainty inherent in statistical models, it also indicates hesitation to question modelers\u2019 authority and conclusions. Dr. Birx\u2019s remarks earlier in the press briefing also contained several appeals to authority, as she named several prestigious institutions involved in the modeling process. It is generally not a sound teaching strategy to rely heavily on appeal to authority, because doing so can encourage passive consumption when active reflection is needed (Amit and Fried, 2005). Furthermore, it creates a perception that there are deterministic principles governing a phenomenon involving some uncertainty and variability. An important aspect of knowledge of content and students is to know that human beings have a tendency to favor deterministic explanations when stochastic ones are more appropriate (Rossman, 2008). Knowing this can help one anticipate the need to avoid framing stochastic situations deterministically.\n\nAn alternative to relying on appeal to authority would be to make the earlier-suggested dynamic model representation available online to the public, keep it up-to-date in terms of the newest available data, and encourage them to check it periodically to see how answers to their questions about mitigation have changed as more data became available. As answers to questions inevitably change in light of new data, the stochastic nature of the situation can become more apparent. This sort of continuous online interaction could foster a more authentic view of the degrees of variability, uncertainty, and predictability in the work of statistical modeling. Another potential benefit of such an approach would be allowing the public to see how their own actions may contribute to changes in the data upon which the model is based, therefore addressing the primary goal of the press briefing. This sort of arrangement could shift an appropriate amount of agency to the public to make projections and influence outcomes. Similar techniques have already been used to help television viewers engage with election data and make predictions. For example, many television networks use dynamic maps during elections to quickly zoom in on data from individual congressional districts and run \u201cwhat-if\u201d results scenarios based on changes in electoral vote inputs. Viewers are often invited to interact with the representation themselves online (e.g., https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/electoral-college-interactive-maps). Such techniques provide a glimpse at what may be possible for dynamic statistical model representations on television and online.\n\nAlthough it is somewhat intuitive to expect that various inputs will produce different outputs as one interacts with a dynamic representation, understanding reasons why the same input may produce different outputs in a statistical model is more complicated. For example, Figure 2 shows a wide band to characterize uncertainty inherent in a model. Most inputs along the horizontal axis correspond to not just a single output, but a range of probable ones. Interactions during the press briefing do little to reveal how the audience interpreted the band of uncertainty in Figure 2, but it seems reasonable to conjecture that few considered statistical variability as an underlying factor. Individuals tend to cite contextual, rather than statistical, sources when prompted to explain sources of uncertainty in predictions (Henriques and Oliveira, 2016). Qualitative explanations for contextual sources of uncertainty are likely to emerge before reasoning that leads to quantification of statistical variability (Manor, Ben-Zvi, and Aridor, 2014). Thorough understanding of statistical variability and its quantification can be difficult to attain even for undergraduates who have taken statistics and/or are preparing to teach it (Lovett and Lee, 2018).\n\nIt is extremely challenging to address gaps in understanding of statistical variability during a brief interaction. Perhaps the most viable way to help the public develop better understanding of statistical variation is to invest more time on repeated sampling and informal inference activities in schools (Pratt and Ainley, 2008). Of course, this would require finding additional instructional time in perpetually crowded curricula, but doing so could improve individuals\u2019 abilities to interpret model elements related to uncertainty such as the band shown in Figure 2. Health care professionals who partner with educators in developing such curricula would be in position to briefly remind the public of their experiences in school when helping them understand statistical variability in the context of health recommendations. Difficulties understanding statistical variability that persist even among those who have experienced enhanced curricula could be documented and used to continuously refine the curricula. Such ongoing interactions between health care professionals and curriculum developers could enhance the SKT of both groups.\n\n3.3 SKT and Disaggregation and Contextualization of Data\nThe projected death toll of 100,000 or more in the slides displayed in Figures 1 and 2 led to a discussion about how individual state data might contribute to the total. During the question-and-answer portion of the briefing, the following exchange occurred:\n\nReporter: Can the country handle that in such a short period of time, within a couple of months? Fifty thousand a month (referring to projection of 100,000 deaths shown in Figure 1).\n\nDr. Fauci: You know, it will be difficult. I mean, no one is denying the fact that we are going through a very, very difficult time right now. I mean, we\u2019re seeing what\u2019s happening in New York. That is really, really tough. And if you extrapolate that to the nation, that will be really tough. But that\u2019s what it is, Jim, and we\u2019re going to have to be prepared for that.\n\nDr. Birx: Yeah, I think because the model\u2014that model that was from IHME (Figure 2)\u2014that\u2019s based and heavily ladened by the data that has come in from New York and New Jersey and Connecticut. So, you know, that can skew to a higher peak and more significant mortality. If all of the other states are able\u2014and all the other metro areas are able to hold that case number down, then it\u2019s a very different picture, but you have to predict on the data you have, which is heavily skewed to New York and New Jersey.\n\nLater in the press briefing, when Dr. Birx was asked if the New York and New Jersey infection patterns (Figure 3) were likely to occur in other states, she replied, \u201cThat\u2019s the piece that we\u2019re trying to prevent in New Orleans, in Detroit, in Chicago, and in Boston right now, and trying to make sure that each of those cities work more like California than the New York metro area.\u201d\n\nIn drawing contrasts among states, Drs. Birx and Fauci implicitly acknowledged the important statistical principle that \u201cdata are not just numbers, they are numbers with a context\u201d (Cobb and Moore, 1997, p. 801). In this case, they tried to convince the audience that it would be more desirable to create contextual circumstances across the United States that resembled those in California rather than those in New York. At one point, Dr. Birx tried to explain the differences in mitigation and timing across states, saying that officials in Washington state and California \u201creally talked to their communities and decided to mitigate\u201d a week or two in advance of New York and New Jersey. She believed this explained why the New York and New Jersey case graphs had large spikes (Figures 3 and 4) and Washington and California did not.\n\nThe connections between data and context Dr. Birx discussed led to mitigation measures in some states, but in other states, some governors quickly cast mitigation measures aside. Various political considerations likely influenced their choices. It is beyond the scope of this essay to review all of these considerations, but it seems likely that statistical reasoning also played a role. Historically, many enacted statistics curricula have suffered from lack of attention to forging connections between data and context (Jones and Tarr, 2010; Makar and Ben-Zvi, 2011); efforts to facilitate this type of reasoning in schools are relatively new (Pfannkuch, 2018). Those with this curricular knowledge, another aspect of SKT, can anticipate a need for a stronger attempt to prompt the audience to build statistical knowledge by \u201ccontinual shuttling backwards and forwards between thinking in the context sphere and the statistical sphere\u201d (Wild and Pfannkuch, 1999, p. 228). Engaging in this type of shuttling allows learners to make conjectures about why observed trends in data are happening and what they mean.\n\nThe spaghetti chart slides used during the press briefing (Figures 3 and 4) do provide starting points for reconciling data and context, as they disaggregated data by region. The main difficulty, however, is they do not readily provide information about the contextual dynamics of each region. Hyperlinking each spaghetti strand to a table and map with details about contextual dynamics for the region it represents may help. Each spaghetti strand could potentially be linked to tables containing information such as mitigation measures, timing of mitigation, types of mitigation, amount of testing, number of cases, number of deaths, maps showing where cases have been clustered, and any other information needed to understand the given region. The ability to link multiple types of representations, on a single screen, for seamless exploration, is another notable technology-based advance in statistics pedagogy over the past two decades (Mojica, Azmy, and Lee, 2019). Knowing of these linking abilities and their potential uses can be considered another aspect of knowledge of content and teaching within SKT. Putting an interactive representation of this nature online (as has been done with dynamic election maps) could make it readily accessible to viewers after the press briefing. Presenters at the press briefing could demonstrate how the display works, encourage others to explore further after the press conference, and make efforts to spread the representation via social media after the press briefing.\n\nAs the public examines statistics such as number of cases and number of deaths in a given region, learning supports to help them discern the affordances and limitations of each statistic would also be desirable. The activities of reading behind the data (Shaughnessy, 2007) and exploring limitations of statistics (Whitin, 2006) have also historically been neglected in many statistics curricula. Knowing this about the curriculum (an aspect of SKT) allows one to anticipate the need to remediate gaps in public knowledge. Relying on a single statistic, such as the number of cases documented, greatly weakens the conclusions one can draw from the data, yet it was a common tendency during the pandemic (Bronner, 2020). Considering complementary information such as number of deaths, hospitalizations, and amount of testing can help one draw more reliable conclusions. Using the press briefing to seed healthy skepticism about the amount of information any statistic on its own can provide and then encouraging online exploration of the earlier-recommended dynamic and linked representations may help the public appreciate important nuances of the situation.\n\n3.4 SKT and Experimental Study Design\nNear the conclusion of the press briefing, discussion turned toward vaccine development. A reporter asked, \u201cHow long does that normally take? Weeks? Months?\u201d Dr. Fauci replied \u201cat least months,\u201d explaining, \u201cthe drugs that you want to show in a good randomized clinical trial, at very best, they\u2019re going to take months.\u201d The concept of clinical trials emerged again when conversation turned toward development of treatments for those who were already infected. A reporter asked President Trump, \u201cGoing back to hydroxychloroquine, how many clinical trial tests, numerically, would you like to see before you put a stamp of approval on it? Because it\u2019s\u2014there are clinical trials being\u2014taking place around the world right now.\u201d Dr. Fauci responded for the President, prompting the following exchange:\n\nReporter: Is there a number? How many cases would you like to see?\n\nDr. Fauci: Yeah. That is an FDA decision and it really depends on a variety of factors. What I would like to see: a clinical trial that has a comparison to something that is comparable to what it means without the drug. I mean, I keep saying it. I say it all the time and I\u2019ll say it again: It\u2019s a controlled trial that compares it to something meaningful. When that\u2014\n\nReporter: Are there particular trials that you\u2019re watching taking place around the world right now?\n\nDr. Fauci: Well, there are a number of trials going on, not only in the United States, but also in other parts of the world. You know, right now, it\u2019s too early to make any determination, but I just want to get back to what I say all the time: The definitive way that you get an answer is by doing a randomized, controlled, clinical trial.\n\nReporter: Dr. Fauci, on social distancing. Or Mr. President\u2014President Trump: You\u2019re talking about the chloroquine? Is that what you\u2019re talking about? In\u2014specifically, per the last question?\n\nReporter: Yes. Hydroxychloroquine.\n\nPresident Trump: Yeah. No, there are trials going on. But there are also trials going on\u2014we\u2019re trying them on people that are now sick. That\u2019s a very important\u2014that\u2019s a very important trial, to me.\n\nAfter this exchange, the conversation turned to other matters.\n\nDuring the exchange above involving Dr. Fauci, news reporters, and President Trump, it was not clear that a shared understanding of the notion of \u201crandomized clinical trial\u201d existed. Reporters alluded to trials taking place around the world with those who were sick. At the time, these were generally observational rather than experimental studies, as indicated by Dr. Fauci\u2019s remarks. The initial reporter question to start the conversation pertained to the number of trials conducted rather than the manner in which they were done. Dr. Fauci then attempted to steer the conversation back to randomized clinical trials. After Dr. Fauci made this statement, though, President Trump seemed to return to something close to the reporter\u2019s original notion of trials, referring to those who were infected and receiving the medicine as a last resort. The entire exchange suggested that the parties involved may have been talking past one another when using the word trial. The knowledge of content and students aspect of SKT can help one anticipate these types of communication difficulties; words such as random and trial that have both well-established colloquial meanings as well as more precise statistical meanings can be particularly troublesome for learners (Kaplan, Fisher, and Rogness, 2010). Helping citizens and elected officials distinguish among these shades of meaning is particularly important when personal health and public policy decisions are at stake.\n\nExplicit language supports can help individuals distinguish between everyday and technical meanings of words. Existing research has begun to shed light on the types of language supports that may be most effective. Kaplan, Rogness, and Fisher (2014) found that a visual analogy contrasting statistical and colloquial meanings of the word random helped improve learners\u2019 understanding. They cautioned, however, that more research was needed on the potential widespread effectiveness of this type of intervention, recommending further research on how and why the changes they observed occurred. Pairing the word random with the phrase clinical trial would likely complicate the intervention further. However, once developed by further research, such interventions could become an important component of the knowledge of content and teaching aspect of SKT. The need for additional research on this aspect of SKT shows that this type of knowledge, just as medical knowledge, needs continuous development through empirical study. Although existing literature suggests aspects of SKT that would be beneficial to health care professionals, SKT is not a static construct ready for simple transmission to users. Both SKT and medicine are aspects of the knowledge base for health care professionals that need continuous empirical development.\n\n4. Implications for the Statistical Education of Health Care Professionals\nThe examples of SKT discussed above are summarized in Table 1. The entries in Table 1 likely represent just a small fraction of the aspects of SKT that are important to health care professionals. From this handful of examples, however, one can begin to recognize that the SKT aspects discussed in this essay can be useful for health care professionals beyond the specific press conference and situation that have been described. Hence, in this section, the potential broader applicability of the SKT elements summarized in Table 1 will be briefly considered.\n\n4.1 Knowledge of Content and Students for Health Care Professionals\nThe knowledge of content and students portion of Table 1 contains examples of common statistical learning issues related to the substance of the press briefing. The first challenge is to develop learners\u2019 abilities to distinguish between deterministic and stochastic phenomena. In this essay, the issue was considered in relation to interpretation of statistical model predictions. The ability to distinguish between deterministic and stochastic phenomena, however, underlies many other medical issues facing the public. For example, people may believe that medical tests provide deterministic results, overlooking possibilities of false positives and false negatives; it is then surprising for them to learn that a test advertised to have 99% accuracy can produce false positives at high rates like 25% under some circumstances (Lyublinskaya, 2005). Also, headlines and images in drug advertisements have the potential to lead the public to deterministic conclusions about drug efficacy (Wilkes, Doblin, and Shapiro, 1992). Advertisements about one drug being more effective than another can exploit colloquial deterministic meanings of effectiveness rather than explaining the more tentative and qualified statistical conclusions drawn in comparative studies.\n\nIt is important for health care professionals to understand the nature, origin, and prevalence of difficulties the public may have interpreting what they read and hear about medicine in everyday life so they can anticipate the need to provide appropriate learning supports. The examples above are by no means exhaustive. They are merely intended to illustrate that the need for SKT related to common patterns of thinking about statistics extends beyond the press briefing considered earlier. The essay examples are also intended to encourage research activity that can more fully characterize the SKT that is needed to educate the public at-large to foster their well-being. Further study of health care professionals in the act of trying to help others understand statistical information could produce a comprehensive inventory of the SKT needed to foster public well-being, just as studies of interactions in statistics classrooms have led to characterizations of the SKT needed by teachers (e.g., Pfannkuch, 2006; Burgess, 2011).\n\n4.2 Knowledge of Content and Teaching for Health Care Professionals\nKnowing the statistical thinking tendencies that exist among the public in regard to health issues is important, but not sufficient. It is also important to have teaching strategies that foster sound understanding. As summarized in the second row of Table 1, recent developments in statistics education technology offer options for doing so. In this essay, it was conjectured that dynamic and linked representations would have enhanced the instruction attempted during the press conference. Technology also offers additional options for addressing the learning difficulties mentioned in the previous section. In particular, many platforms afford the ability to conduct simulations that demonstrate frequencies of random outcomes (Garfield and Ben-Zvi, 2008). Examining such frequencies can help users develop sounder intuition about issues such as occurrence of false positives (Lyublinskaya, 2005) and the likely range of conclusions that might be drawn when an experiment comparing two treatments is replicated many times (Chance, Wong, and Tintle, 2016). Although interpreting simulations has its own challenges (Case and Jacobbe, 2018), there is growing evidence that simulation-based approaches are more effective than traditional approaches to teaching inference (Chance, Wong, and Tintle, 2016). As research on SKT related to health issues becomes more prevalent, it would be wise to interrogate and continuously improve all of the capabilities that statistics education technology currently has to offer to support the development of knowledge of content and teaching.\n\nMany attempts to provide technology-based learning supports for interpreting COVID-19 data and models did, in fact, emerge as the pandemic spread. For example, some websites used dynamic models that allowed for the alteration of inputs and outputs to help users see how the spread of a virus would change in response to different conditions (e.g., https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/, https://www.nctm.org/Classroom-Resources/Illuminations/Interactives/Pandemics-How-Are-Viruses-Spread/). Others provided dashboards and continuous updates on data pertaining to the spread of the virus (e.g., https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). No such tools, however, were featured during the press briefing considered in this essay. Statistical models and data were prominently featured during the briefing. However, the conduct of the press briefing, which was viewed by millions at a critical time in the spread of the pandemic, did not reflect a corresponding degree of attention to how individuals interpret models and data or contemporary learning supports to help the interpretation process. Given that a main goal of the press briefing was to use statistics to argue that government-created mitigation measures were necessary, a greater degree of attention to choosing appropriate teaching strategies would have been desirable. The need for SKT in this highly visible situation amplifies the need for health care professionals to have similar knowledge to support their private professional interactions with individuals as well; collectively, such smaller-scale interactions also have a large impact on overall public health.\n\n4.3 Knowledge of Curriculum for Health Care Professionals\nThe press briefing reflections also amplify the need for knowledge of statistics curricula among health care professionals. People are not blank slates; rather, they bring past experiences to bear in any situation. Experiences with school statistics curricula influence their interpretation of messages health care professionals attempt to convey. At present, it is important for health care professionals to know that many statistics curricula currently suffer from lack of attention to reconciling data and context, reading behind the data, and understanding limitations of individual statistical measures. The impacts of these deficits on the ability of the public to understand press briefing remarks were discussed earlier. Beyond the press briefing, many media stories omit information or make errors when reporting the contextual details of medical research studies (Chang, 2015) or intentionally sensationalize them (Shuchman and Wilkes, 1997). The public often struggles to interpret and scrutinize media stories in a sound manner (Adams et al., 2017). Many current statistics curricula exacerbate the problem by not including opportunities for students to carefully interpret data in context. This makes it less likely that readers of media stories will probe the underlying contextual details of the research on which the stories are based. Knowing of such curriculum-induced challenges to helping individuals intelligently examine statistical claims is important for health care professionals charged with advising the public.\n\nOf course, there are even more pressing matters than knowledge of curriculum deficits; it is important to work toward sounder statistics curriculum strategies. K-12 curriculum improvements in statistics and probability have been uneven over the past several decades. Once reserved mainly for post-secondary study, probability and statistics gained momentum as strands running through the entire K-12 curriculum near the end of the twentieth century with the release of Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1989) and Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000). More recently, however, Curriculum Focal Points (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2006) and the Common Core State Standards (Common Core State Standards Initiative, 2010) removed most probability and statistics content from the elementary grades. Some countries that once engaged young children in studying intuitive ideas of probability have removed probability from their early grades curricula (Langrall, 2018). The erratic starts and stops in curriculum reform in statistics and probability have made it difficult to achieve meaningful, lasting progress to help all citizens develop sound statistical and probabilistic reasoning. The COVID-19 pandemic vividly illustrates the pressing need for widespread statistical literacy, lending urgency to efforts to improve K-12 statistics and probability curricula.\n\nAt present, health care professionals need to know the nature of prevailing statistics curricula so they can anticipate extant gaps in statistical knowledge they are likely to encounter. Ideally, such knowledge would not only help them carry out their traditional professional responsibilities, but also prompt them to become partners in efforts to improve existing statistics curricula. Such partnerships should aim to enhance the public\u2019s statistical thinking abilities on a broad scale. Meaningful curriculum reform is a complex, gradual process, so efforts of this nature must be sustained over a long period of time to effect change. Recognizing the connections between the public\u2019s statistical literacy and their overall health and well-being may help foster the perseverance needed to develop and build long-lasting partnerships for curricular reform and further SKT research.\n\n5. Concluding Reflections\nIf one accepts the argument that SKT is an important aspect of the knowledge base for health care professionals, it is natural to ask how to include it in already overburdened medical school curricula. One possibility would be to purposefully develop SKT in already-required statistics courses. Models for teacher education provide strategies for addressing SKT and conventional statistics subject matter knowledge alongside one another in the same course (e.g., Groth, 2012; Green and Blankenship, 2013; Biehler, Frischemeier, and Podworny, 2018). One advantage of integrating SKT outcomes is that doing so provides opportunities to reflect on common statistical misunderstandings and how to remediate them. Potential (and practicing) health care professionals are not immune to such misunderstandings themselves. For example, Lang (2007) reported frequent errors in biomedical journals pertaining to interpretation and use of statistical significance, standard error, and standard deviation. Studying common statistical misunderstandings of others as part of required statistics coursework has the potential to make health care professionals more self-aware of the need to address such misunderstandings in their own thinking. Hence, in a carefully designed course, the study of SKT could actually enhance their subject matter knowledge rather than taking time away from its development.\n\nEven with improved coursework, however, it should be acknowledged that work demands make it difficult for health care professionals to stay abreast of all emerging research on the teaching and learning of statistics. In regard to the press briefing considered in this essay, for example, the technology-based pedagogical tools recommended to enhance the briefing did not exist when the two doctors presenting were in medical school. In high-stakes efforts to educate the public, a team approach is needed. The examples in this essay suggest that having statistics education specialists on such teams is essential so that common statistical thinking patterns are taken into account and addressed in the most effective ways possible. If the public is not convinced that mitigation measures are needed on the basis of empirical evidence, the only teaching tool that remains is appeal to authority. Relying on appeal to authority alone is not only unsound pedagogically; in a democratic society it can, and did, cause systematic backlash against the recommended measures. As the so-called \u201cpandemic playbooks\u201d in various countries around the world are scrutinized and revised in the wake of COVID-19, democratic countries would be especially remiss to ignore the role of statistics education in their observed successes and failures during the pandemic.\n\nJust as enhanced SKT can help improve medical education, recognizing it as necessary for medical education can help improve SKT research. To remain viable, both SKT and medicine require continually growing and evolving bodies of knowledge based on empirical data. Partnerships between statistics education researchers and medical researchers would be mutually beneficial. For example, as suggested earlier, statistics education researchers might analyze the clinical practice of doctors by using tools that have been developed to examine teachers\u2019 SKT in conventional classroom settings (e.g., Pfannkuch, 2006; Burgess, 2011). As another example, technology-based teaching tools could be examined for their effectiveness in health care contexts and then refined in response to peoples\u2019 thinking about them; such investigations could benefit from methods and tools developed for design-based research in statistics (Bakker and van Eerde, 2015) that allow researchers to develop and improve the tools in a bootstrapping fashion. This essay only scratches the surface in providing direction for partnerships between statistics education researchers and medical researchers. The conjectures offered herein provide potential starting points for such efforts, but many other focus areas are ripe for identification and empirical study.\n\nIn closing, it is useful to revisit Shulman\u2019s (1987) original characterization of pedagogical content knowledge as the \u201cspecial amalgam of content and pedagogy that is uniquely the province of teachers, their own special form of professional understanding\u201d (p. 8). In light of the examples offered in this essay, one might question whether such knowledge should really be just \u201cuniquely the province of teachers.\u201d Or, if one holds to the original characterization, it must be acknowledged that health care professionals need to be considered statistics teachers in their own right. In any case, we must find ways to better prepare them to carry out their teaching functions and provide extra support as needed, especially in large-scale, high-stakes scenarios such as COVID-19. Improving society\u2019s capacity to more effectively teach statistical thinking before and during situations where public health hangs in the balance is paramount.", "extra_context": {"keywords": ["Dynamic statistics software", "Medical research", "Pedagogical content knowledge", "Statistical knowledge for teaching", "Statistical thinking"], "authors": ["Randall E.

Two measures of governance quality (i.e., political stability and rule of law) are shown to be relatively more significant in aiding favorable trade regulations that promote export entrepreneurship.

The rebels used the claim of sole representation to ensure bilateral talks with the government, get the ban on it lifted, and control the proposed interim administrative structure.

Using a panel of industry-specific US regulatory restrictions, we found that a 10% increase in federal regulations was associated with an approximate 0.8% reduction in small firms\u2019 share of industry employment and a nearly 1.5% decline in small firms\u2019 share of industry output.", "extra_context": {"authors": ["Dustin Chambers", "Jang-Ting Guo"], "date": "20 January 2021", "journal": "Pacific Economic Review", "volume": 28, "issue": 4, "pages": "503-518", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0106.12353", "citations": 5}}, {"abstract": "EP-01 Fitness Assessment, Exercise Training, and Performance of Athletes and Healthy People\nCOMPARISON OF SPRINT INTERVAL TRAINING AND MODERATE INTENSITY CONTINUOUS TRAINING TO MAXIMIZE NEUROMUSCULAR ADAPTATIONS\n89\nMoghaddam, Masoud1; Estrada, Carlos A.2; Muddle, Tyler W.D.3; Jacobson, Bert H.4\nAuthor Information\n1 Salisbury University, Salisbury, MD.\n2 Aurora University, Aurora, IL.\n3 Mississippi University for Women, Columbus, MS.\n4 Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK.\nMedicine & Science in Sports & Exercise 53(8S):p 28, August 2021. | DOI: 10.1249/01.mss.0000759368.70965.fb\nFree\n\nMetrics\nSprint interval training (SIT) refers to a group of sprint bouts separated by rest periods. SIT is a time-efficient strategy to improve aerobic performance similar to moderate intensity continuous training (MICT). There has been a relative absence of studies on neuromuscular adaptations of SIT.\nPURPOSE: To compare the effects of stationary air biking, utilizing high-volume MICT and low-volume SIT (i.e., ultrashort-SIT [US], short-SIT [SS]) on neuromuscular system.\nMETHODS: Thirty recreationally active females were randomly assigned to MICT (n = 10), US (n = 10), and SS (n = 10) groups. The intervention consisted of 3 d/wk for 4 wks. MICT was performed by 30 min of cycling at 75% of maximal heart rate reserve, while SIT (i.e., US, SS) consisted of 3 sets of 8 intervals at maximal effort intensity. SS and US were performed with 20s:10s and 10s:5s work-to-rest ratios and provided with 5- and 2.5-min recovery periods between sets, respectively. Muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) and echo intensity (EI) of rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL) were measured by ultrasound system. Isometric strength testing protocol consisted of 3 maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC). During each contraction, surface electromyography (sEMG) and torque signals were recorded to assess sEMG amplitude (RMS) of RF and VL as well as peak torque (PT). All variables were measured before and after intervention and were analyzed with 2-way mixed factorial ANOVAs. Moreover, average total work (TW) during 12 sessions was recorded and analyzed with one-way ANOVA.\nRESULTS: There were significant (p < 0.05) differences in TW (MICT: 142.7 \u00b1 31.5 cal., US: 52.6 \u00b1 10.0 cal., SS: 92.3 \u00b1 7.8 cal.) between groups. All groups significantly (p < 0.05) improved mCSA of RF (MICT: 9.0 \u00b1 1.0 to 9.5 \u00b1 1.1 cm2, US: 9.9 \u00b1 3.5 to 10.6 \u00b1 3.6 cm2, SS: 9.0 \u00b1 1.9 to 9.7 \u00b1 1.5 cm2) and VL (MICT: 20.0 \u00b1 2.3 to 20.6 \u00b1 2.1 cm2, US: 20.8 \u00b1 5.1 to 22.5 \u00b1 5.2 cm2, SS: 19.6 \u00b1 2.6 to 21.4 \u00b1 3.8 cm2). No significant (p > 0.05) differences observed in EI values as well as RMS and PT during MVIC.\nCONCLUSION: Despite no significant improvements in neural activation and isometric strength, all groups similarly improved muscular morphology of RF and VL by performing SIT on a stationary air bike. These findings suggest that SIT can elicit muscular morphological adaptations with a shorter time commitment.\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 by the American College of Sports Medicine\nView full article text", "extra_context": {"keywords": ["Fitness Assessment", "Exercise Training", "Performance of Athletes", "Sprint Interval Training", "Moderate Intensity Continuous Training", "Neuromuscular Adaptations"], "authors": ["Moghaddam, Masoud", "Estrada, Carlos A.", "Muddle, Tyler W.D.", "Jacobson, Bert H."], "date": "August 2021", "journal": "Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise", "volume": "53(8S)", "page": "28", "doi": "10.1249/01.mss.0000759368.70965.fb"}}, {"abstract": "ABSTRACT\nAs lesson study becomes more prevalent, there is a need to continuously develop theoretical and methodological infrastructure to support and refine its use. In this article, we present a critical methodological analysis of the challenges and benefits of using Toulmin\u2019s argumentation model in mathematics education to assess the debriefing phase of lesson study. During debriefing sessions, teachers offer arguments about how to improve teaching that are grounded in observations of students\u2019 learning. Toulmin\u2019s model provides a means to analyze the structure of such arguments. Using an empirical example, we illustrate challenges of using the model, such as determining appropriate grain sizes for data and claims, evaluating qualifiers, recognizing multiple categories of backing, identifying implicit warrants, and deciding between the individual or the group as a unit of analysis. We also discuss benefits such as being able to systematically compare mathematics teachers\u2019 pedagogical arguments against one another, assess attainment of debriefing session goals, and characterize group discursive dynamics. Despite the challenges of using the Toulmin model, we conclude that it provides a useful framework for systematic analysis of lesson study debriefing sessions. The present article can help researchers anticipate and address challenges of conducting Toulmin-based qualitative analyses of debriefing session discourse.\n\nKEYWORDS: Lesson study, argumentation, discourse, qualitative research, professional development\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under award DUE-1852139.

This paper investigates whether or not there are salary benefits for IT professionals that possess ITIL\u00ae knowledge and skill and what are the estimated benefits, if any.

Conspecifics can recognize these signals and behaviorally respond in sex-specific ways. However, we know little about how males and females might differ in their responses to signals from individuals or how the sexes might differ in their ability to recognize their own identity. Such signals of identity are important because they can modulate the behavior of receivers, and allow for responses related to aggression, territory maintenance, affiliation, and reproduction. To assess how males and females might differ in their responses to individual familiar and novel social signals, and their own individual signals compared to novel same-sex conspecifics, we tested southern giant pouched rats (Cricetomys ansorgei) using a habituation\u2013discrimination paradigm. Only females showed individual recognition and discriminated among males, preferring novel males. Females also discriminated between their own scent and a novel conspecific odor. Males did not discriminate or demonstrate individual recognition. Male and female differences in response to opposite-sex odors demonstrated that males do not discriminate between familiar and novel reproductively available females, but females discriminate and prefer to investigate novel males.\n\n---\n\n**Supporting Information:**  \n- Filename: eth13223-sup-0001-FigS1.docx  \n- Description: Word document, 164.8 KB  \n- Filename: eth13223-sup-0002-TableS1.docx  \n- Description: Word document, 20.7 KB  \n- Filename: eth13223-sup-0003-TableS2.docx  \n- Description: Word document, 15.2 KB  \n\n**References:**  \nAjayi, S., Tewe, O.

Courses cover a wide array of diverse topics and can vary in terms of effort level and pedagogical approach. They have evolved from an experiment in global course interactions to offering college credit, professional certifications, professional development credits, college course supplemental material, incorporation in college campus education, and career gap\u2013specific courses while reaching as many learners as possible. Most are associated with universities and taught by professors, produced via a partnership of universities with online learning platforms, such as edX\u00ae and Coursera. A variety of educational tools can be incorporated, such as interactive modules, video lectures, reference materials, assessments, collaborative lessons, discussion boards, and peer-reviewed assignments. Newer MOOCs feature chatbots and adaptive algorithm models that adjust to learners' prior knowledge and question responsiveness. They can be easily accessed by anyone, provided they have an internet connection, language proficiency (most are only available in English), and computer literacy (Setia et al., 2019). Many MOOCs offer an audit track, which provides access to all course materials for a limited time except graded assignments; they are typically free but learners are unable to earn a \u201ccertificate\u201d under this option. To earn a verified certificate, learners pay a fee and must complete specified assessments, discussions, and/or other assigned learning activities.\n\nMillions of learners of various ages, backgrounds, interests, and goals typically enroll in these courses. As a form of e-learning, MOOCs continue to emerge as a particularly valuable strategy to address some of the training challenges experienced in developing countries by supporting efficient content delivery, decreasing costs, and increasing access (Liyanagunawardena & Aboshady, 2018). MOOCs have been shown to significantly improve outreach regarding public health concerns, as well as providing necessary training for health care professionals and the general public. The most recent report presented at the edX Virtual Forum (2020) documents >35 million learners with 110 million unique enrollments spanning 196 countries. Furthermore, MOOCs are particularly suited for addressing health topics while attracting global learners from low-resource contexts (Barteit et al., 2019). Currently, health and medicine are estimated to account for only a small percentage of MOOCs; topics have included nutrition, stress management, alternative therapies, mental health, ethics, global health, and health care leadership. Other courses are more disease- or condition-specific, such as hypertension, menopause, and pediatric injuries, as well as HIV and addiction. However, what seems to be substantially lacking are courses focused on conditions related to aging and issues impacting older adults.\n\nAs part of a concerted effort to address this dearth of gero-focused content, two MOOCs were launched by Salisbury University's School of Nursing in conjunction with USMx, an initiative through the University System of Maryland's William E. Kirwan Center for Academic Innovation (access  [https://www.edx.org/course/overview-management-ofparkinsons-disease-2](https://www.edx.org/course/overview-management-ofparkinsons-disease-2);  [https://www.edx.org/course/alzheimers-disease-dementia-care](https://www.edx.org/course/alzheimers-disease-dementia-care)). The two courses, titled Overview of Parkinson's Disease & Management and Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Care, were purposely designed to appeal to lay persons and caregivers, as well as health care professionals working with these patient populations. These courses include a variety of teaching modalities to enhance learner engagement, such as introductory/summary videos for each of the five modules, check your knowledge questions, web links, embedded visuals/videos, as well as video interviews with a person with Parkinson's disease and an Alzheimer's care-giver, respectively, followed by reflective discussion. The response to these self-paced, gero-focused offerings has been overwhelmingly positive, and data show the goal of reaching a wide audience with varying skills was exceeded within the first year. Collectively, there are >12,000 learners and growing, reaching more than 140 countries, with the United States only making up 15% to 20% of the enrolled population. Of these learners who self-reported demographic information for the two courses, approximately 65% are female and 35% are male and median age is 28 years. Approximately 26% have a high school diploma or less, and 24% have an advanced degree. Although these MOOCs, which launched in late 2019/early 2020, likely experienced heightened interest due to the COVID-19\u2013induced lockdown worldwide, the far-reaching nature of these courses as a cost-effective way to introduce a widespread audience to pertinent gerontological topics of interest is markedly clear.\n\nEven with their growing popularity, scholarly debate continues regarding benefits versus concerns when offering free and open content to an international audience. Limitations can include low-quality or non-engaging instruction, passive learning, course difficulty, and low average completion rates despite free content (Setia et al., 2019). High drop-out rates remain a much-criticized issue (Chan et al., 2019). Suggested strategies for improving participation and completion rates while enhancing perceived value would include offering courses of shorter duration and incorporating good-quality media. Furthermore, advertising courses through multiple credible channels (including social media platforms) can spread awareness about e-learning opportunities (Setia et al., 2019). Incentives can include offering certificates, credits, or professional credit; providing learning support and learner feedback; and using data to analyze drop-out points to drive course improvements (Chan et al., 2019).\n\nMOOCs can provide a free and accessible way for learners to be exposed to new topics or disciplines while providing a forum to stimulate new interests and ideas. They can serve as an effective and efficient method to provide education regarding health topics while creating a diverse and interactive community of global learners. MOOCs that address issues specific to the geriatric population can go beyond disease-oriented topics to those that explore broader concerns related to aging, such as polypharmacy, health promotion, transitions in care, end-of-life decision making, and the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in optimizing care outcomes. Although MOOCs can be resource-intensive to develop, the rewards of educating a global audience can be particularly satisfying. High-quality MOOCs developed by knowledgeable faculty and/or expert health care professionals can provide a learning environment where gerontological nurses and other health care providers, as well as lay persons/caregivers from various geographic regions, cultures, and backgrounds, can connect and share experiences. Nursing faculty, in collaboration with practicing gerontological nurses, have the opportunity to provide cutting edge MOOCs to not only enhance learning among students and health care peers to enhance practice, but also inform the global community at large about pertinent geriatric topics.", "extra_context": {"authors": ["Mary C.

Communities had to retreat indoors and socially distance from one another. One aspect of life that drastically changed was schooling. It moved from traditional face-to-face spaces to online digital platforms.

The purpose was to 1) evaluate PA levels utilizing FITT-VP principles and 2) compare the patterns of PA in NA men and women.\n\n**Methods**\nRecruitment and evaluation (n = 586) took place as part of the OPREVENT2 study baseline evaluation. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire\u2013Short Form assessed frequency (days per week), intensity (walking, moderate, vigorous), and time (minutes per day). The total MET-minutes for the previous 7 d provided the volume of activity.\n\n**Results**\nThe NA sample was 45.8 \u00b1 15.1 yr of age, with a body mass index of 31.5 \u00b1 6.4 kg\u00b7m\u22122. The FIT-V corresponded to 4.7 \u00b1 2.3 d\u00b7wk\u22121, walking (3.3 METs intensity), 52 \u00b1 47 min\u00b7d\u22121, and 2536 \u00b1 2203 MET\u00b7min\u22121. The men (n = 162) reported a greater frequency of 3.2 \u00b1 2.5 d\u00b7wk\u22121 (P = 0.007) of vigorous activity lasting 55 \u00b1 50 min\u00b7d\u22121 compared with the women (n = 433) with 2.6 \u00b1 2.5 d\u00b7wk\u22121 of vigorous activity lasting 34 \u00b1 38 min\u00b7d\u22121. The men reported higher MET-minutes than did the women (P = 0.0001). Overall, 71% of men and 77% of women met the recommended PA guidelines.\n\n**Conclusions**\nGiven that the majority of NA report adequate walking time and frequency, interventions are needed to improve moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic fitness, as well as muscular strength and endurance, neuromotor, and flexibility activities.\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\nParticipation in regular physical activity (PA) has many known health benefits including reductions in cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and reducing weight and obesity. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Native Americans (NA) in the United States (1,2). In addition, the high prevalence of diabetes and obesity in the NA population is well documented (3\u20135). Obesity is also associated with lower levels of PA in Pima Indians (6). Given these negative health indicators in NA, identifying and modifying risk factors is a priority. One strong modifiable protective factor against these diseases is regular PA (7,8).\n\nIn order to prescribe the appropriate PA to specific populations, such as NA, it is necessary to understand current activity behaviors. The optimal exercise prescription for healthy adults is to include a mix of cardiorespiratory (aerobic) fitness, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, and neuromotor fitness (9\u201311). Also recommended is a reduction in sedentary activities (9). These recommendations are based on an abundance of scientific evidence of the benefits of exercise, including its effects on cardiovascular disease and obesity (11). The current frequency, intensity, time, type, volume, and progression (FITT-VP) guidelines from the American College of Sports Medicine for aerobic fitness includes 3\u20135 times per week, at a moderate intensity (40%\u201359% heart rate reserve), 30\u201360 min\u00b7d\u22121, rhythmic aerobic exercises (e.g., walking), and a volume progression tailored to the individual\u2019s goals (9). Other guidelines exist for muscular strength and endurance, and neuromotor and flexibility activities (9).\n\nComparing current PA in NAs across studies can prove to be challenging because researchers using self-report methods summarized PA differently. For example, studies estimated PA in terms of the total PA by MET score separated by intensity levels (12), the total leisure time of PA (13), the frequency (number of times per week) at various intensities (12,14), or the volume as total MET-hours per week (13,15). In addition, a few studies have separated their findings by sex and included one or two components of the FITT-VP. For example, studies have shown lower levels of vigorous activity in Lakota Indian women compared with men (14) and higher volume (METs per week) in men (15). Thus, not only is it important to delineate between how often, how hard, and the mode of activity, the total amount of activity is necessary when designing and implementing interventions. The intervention strategies for activity may also differ between men and women. This study was completed to inform PA practices for a multi-institutional obesity control and prevention intervention program in NA communities in the United States (16).\n\nIn addition, it is clinically relevant to examine those who meet PA guidelines. A systematic review (17) of PA in NA populations residing in Canada and in the United States examined self-report, objective (via accelerometry and pedometers), and metabolic (via doubly labeled water) measures of PA. Only 27.2% of adults met the PA recommendations (18). However, slightly higher PA estimates ranging from 35% to 39% have also been documented (13). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report from the 2008\u20132017 surveys indicated that 54.1% of all adults met the minimum aerobic PA guideline, and this percentage fell to 37.0% when considering those meeting the high aerobic PA guideline (18). Given these examples, comparing the PA levels in NA among the studies provides a challenge that ultimately influences the design of lifestyle interventions aimed at improving the health of individuals in these communities.\n\nThis study uniquely identifies the components of a PA prescription for NA communities, by separating out how often (frequency), how hard (intensity), how long (time), and the energy expenditure (volume) of PA. The objectives of this study are therefore to 1) describe PA levels utilizing the FITT-V principles and 2) compare the patterns of PA in NA men and women.\n\n**METHODS**\n\n**Research Design**\nAdults were sampled from six NA communities in the United States, two in the Upper Midwest and four in the Southwest as part of the baseline evaluation for an intervention trial, Obesity Prevention and Evaluation of InterVention Effectiveness in Native Americans 2 (OPREVENT2) (16). The evaluation sample included NA adults aged 18\u201375 yr who were recruited from household lists provided by each community. One adult (male or female) per household that identified as the main food preparer was selected and interviewed. The protocol and intervention have been described in detail elsewhere (16).\n\nOPREVENT2 received institutional review board approval from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Institutional Review Board, the relevant tribal Human Research Review Boards, and the Indian Health Service Institutional Review Board, as well as approvals from individual tribal councils (16).\n\nAll data collectors were trained by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and included tribal or local community members who in the Southwest were fluent in the Native language, as well as graduate students from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. Signed consent forms were obtained from all respondents.\n\n**Data Collection Instruments**\nThe Adult Impact Questionnaire (AIQ) is a self-reported tool and was utilized to collect information on the household food getting frequency, household patterns of food and PA, adult food preparation methods, change agent roles, adult knowledge, adult self-efficacy, adult intentions, community resources and environment, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire\u2013Short Form (IPAQ-SF), sociodemographics, family and personal medical history, food assistance, and anthropometry measures. This instrument was developed by Gittelsohn and colleagues (16) and is designed for NA communities. In this article, employment and smoking status are reported from the AIQ. Blood pressure was taken while seated following standard procedures (16). The frequency of hypertension was calculated based on the mean of the duplicate measures. Height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms) were measured in duplicate and used to calculate body mass index (BMI) (16).\n\nThe IPAQ-SF assesses frequency, duration, and three intensity levels of activity: walking (3.3 METs), moderate intensity (4.0 METs), and vigorous intensity (8 METs), and separate scores were provided for each (19). The use of this instrument has been validated in the NA population (20\u201322) and has been described in detail elsewhere (23). Modifications to the instrument were made following formative research (18) so as to be more culturally relevant, with scenarios given. For instance, the participant was asked \u201cIf you walk as part of your ranching activities, how far did you walk and how many days/week did you do this?\u201d An additional question asking whether the level of activity reported in the last 7 d was less than average, average, or more than average was also added.\n\nA total of 601 NA adults from six different communities were interviewed.\n\n**Data Management**\n**Scoring of the IPAQ-SF**\nThe IPAQ-SF scoring protocol delineates between levels of PA and allows for assessment of total PA (19). The levels of PA are separated into three groups: 1) inactive (category 1) includes those who did not meet the criteria for moderate or vigorous activity; 2) minimally active (category 2) includes those who meet one of the following: 3 or more days of vigorous-intensity exercise of at least 20 min\u00b7d\u22121 and 5 or more days of moderate-intensity exercise; and 3) health enhancing physical activity (HEPA) active (category 3) includes those who exceed the minimum public health PA recommendations. Inactive is the lowest category of PA, in which individuals who do not meet the criteria in the other categories are placed.\n\nIn addition to the intensity measures from the IPAQ-SF, the time spent in each category (days per week) was calculated. The total MET-minutes for the previous 7 d was calculated and then compared with the recommended PA guidelines from the IPAQ (19).\n\n**Analysis**\nDescriptive statistics were completed using Stata 14.1 software. A Pearson \u03c72 test was used to evaluate differences between sexes. An independent t-test of equal variance was used to examine differences between sexes for continuous variables including MET-minutes per week and others.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\n**Descriptive Characteristics and FITT-V**\nTable 1 shows the characteristics of the adults in the OPREVENT2 evaluation sample. Of the participants (n = 586), most were female (72.4%). The average age of the participants was 45.8 \u00b1 15.1 yr, ranging from 18 to 75 yr. The sample\u2019s BMI was 31.5 \u00b1 6.4 kg\u00b7m\u22122. About half of the male (45%) and the female (57%) participants were in the obese category as defined as a BMI >30 kg\u00b7m\u22122. A higher percentage of the participants were employed full-time (41.7%) versus not employed (21.9%). In the sample, 28.5% were smokers. The blood pressure was 136/85 mm Hg and 132/81 mm Hg for the men and women, respectively. The frequency of hypertension was reported as 35.3% for the entire sample.\n\n**TABLE 1** - Demographic and Physical Characteristics.\n\nAll (n = 586)\nMen (n = 162)\nWomen (n = 424)\n\nAge, median (range), yr\n45.8 (18\u201375)\n43.9 (18\u201375)\n46.5 (18\u201375)\n\n18\u201324 yr, %\n27.0\n30.9\n25.5\n\n25\u201354 yr, %\n40.4\n42.0\n39.9\n\n54\u201375 yr, %\n32.4\n26.5\n34.7\n\nUnreported, %\n0.2\n0.6\n0.0\n\nBMI status\n\nBMI, kg\u00b7m\u22122\n31.5 \u00b1 6.4\n30.3 \u00b1 5.6\n31.9 \u00b1 6.6\n\n% sample underweight\n0.3\n0.6\n0.2\n\n% sample normal weight\n14.0\n15.4\n13.4\n\n% sample overweight\n24.9\n29.0\n23.4\n\n% sample obese\n53.9\n45.1\n57.3\n\n% unreported weight/BMI\n6.8\n9.9\n5.7\n\nEmployment\n\nEmployed full-time, %\n41.7\n\nEmployed Part-time, %\n12.1\n\nNot employed, %\n21.9\n\nSmoking status (n = 601)\n\nSmoker, %\n28.5\n\nHypertension\n\nSBP, mm Hg\n132.9\n135.7 \u00b1 19.0\n131.8 \u00b1 19.5\n\nDBP, mm Hg\n81.7\n84.8 \u00b1 12.1\n80.5 \u00b1 11.9\n\nFrequency of HTN, %\n35.3\n43.8\n32.1\n\nData are means \u00b1 SEM or %.DBP, diastolic blood pressure; HTN, hypertension; SBP, systolic blood pressure.\n\nBased on the IPAQ-SF, most of the participants were in the active categories (Fig. 1).

The reported volume of PA was either 1500 MET-min\u00b7wk\u22121 (at least 3 d of vigorous activity) or 3000 MET-min\u00b7wk\u22121 (from 7 or more days of any combination of walking, moderate intensity, or vigorous intensity). Therefore, 24.4% of the participants were in the inactive category and did not fall into either of the aforementioned categories.\n\n**FIGURE 1**: Percentage of NA study sample engaged in PA by category.\n\n**TABLE 2** - PA (FIT-V) in NA Adults.\n\nFrequency, d\u00b7wk\u22121\n\nIntensity\nTime, min\u00b7d\u22121\n\nVolume, MET\u00b7min\u22121\n\nAll (n = 586)\n4.7 \u00b1 2.3\nWalking\n52 \u00b1 47\n698 \u00b1 742\n\n3.6 \u00b1 2.5\nModerate\n55 \u00b1 49\n788 \u00b1 919\n\n2.8 \u00b1 2.6\nVigorous\n39 \u00b1 42\n1050 \u00b1 1278\n\nTotal: 2536 \u00b1 2203\n\nMen (n = 162)\n4.7 \u00b1 2.4\nWalking\n57 \u00b1 48\n730 \u00b1 746\n\n3.6 \u00b1 2.5\nModerate\n67 \u00b1 55\n897 \u00b1 1075\n\n3.2 \u00b1 2.5*\nVigorous\n55 \u00b1 50\n1391 \u00b1 1492**\n\nTotal: 3018 \u00b1 2601***\n\nWomen (n = 424)\n4.6 \u00b1 2.3\nWalking\n51 \u00b1 46\n686 \u00b1 741\n\n3.6 \u00b1 2.5\nModerate\n51 \u00b1 46\n746 \u00b1 850\n\n2.6 \u00b1 2.6\nVigorous\n34 \u00b1 38\n920 \u00b1 1162\n\nTotal: 2352 \u00b1 2004\n\nValues reported as means \u00b1 SEM.*P = 0.0072, men versus women.**P = 0.0001, men versus women.***P = 0.001, men versus women.\n\n**Results for Meeting PA Guidelines**\nAbout 75% of the sample met the requirements for weekly PA set by the IPAQ-SF, as shown in (Fig. 2). Specifically, 71% of the men and 77% of the women met these requirements (nonsignificant difference).\n\n**FIGURE 2**: Sample meeting PA guidelines.\n\n**Additional Results from the IPAQ**\nTwo questions in the AIQ provided some context pertinent to understanding the PA levels in this community. The first question was as follows: \u201cin the last 7 days, was your level of physical activity less than usual, usual, or more than usual?\u201d Most (74.5%) of the participants reported \u201cusual,\u201d with 18.4% reporting \u201cless than usual\u201d and 6.9% reporting \u201cmore than usual\u201d activity. The second question was as follows: \u201cThe next time you have free time at home, what will you do?\u201d Of the three choices, the responses included 8.5% \u201ctake a nap,\u201d 67.6% \u201cwalk/housework,\u201d and 24.0% \u201cTV/computer.\u201d\n\n**DISCUSSION**\nUtilizing a PA self-report instrument such as the IPAQ, allowed for the frequency, intensity, time, and volume of PA to be described for NAs living in six communities in the United States. The study also revealed that three-fourths of this sample self-reported their PA levels as minimally active or HEPA active.\nFor the FITT-V, the study revealed a frequency (days per week) in the range of 3\u20135 d. This falls into the guidelines for aerobic activity for adults (7). Of the three intensities (walking, moderate, and vigorous), the participants reported a greater number of days walking. Similarly, the time (minutes per day) spent at each of these intensities was slightly longer for walking and moderate intensities compared with vigorous. The mean time was over 50 min\u00b7d\u22121. Men reported being physically active slightly above the recommended time of 30\u201360 min\u00b7d\u22121 for moderate activity. All of these factors can be used to design PA interventions that could then be adjusted as the individuals improve. The individual\u2019s progression should be monitored to improve or maintain cardiorespiratory fitness. Clearly, this sample of NA men and women is doing well with their aerobic or cardiorespiratory endurance activities in terms of the number of days per week and the duration of the activities. Evidence from the researchers on site at these communities reveals high levels of physical labor (e.g., as part of their occupations) and active lifestyle behaviors (e.g., walking to the store) that are a part of everyday life. Other examples include chopping wood, herding sheep, and walking as a means of transportation, as many lack vehicular transportation and must walk to the centers, schools, stores, and their jobs (casino, oil rigs). Other researchers interested in PA in NA have explored traditional harvesting physical activities and linked these activities to tribal self-identification and speaking a native language at home (24). Thus, these traditional types of activities need to be included into the FITT-V model, as they are critical to NA culture.\n\nThe difference in vigorous activity between men and women for the number of days per week and time (minutes per day) was significantly higher in men than in women. There is a nonsignificant difference in the volume of activity between the men and the women. Other studies have reported no differences between men and women in self-reported physical inactivity (25), but PA levels have shown to be higher in men than in women (14). These differences between sexes could be partly attributed to the type of employment.\n\nA common reason cited by the participants during interviews for long periods of time spent walking was working as a food server, construction, casino worker, or other physically demanding jobs. The adults in these NA communities are reporting to spend over 50 min\u00b7d\u22121 walking. Attempts to obtain objective data from a small sample of participants who wore a pedometer was challenging, and the data were not analyzed. It is clear, however, from the field site investigators that the range of activity levels in the participants could be due to the variability in occupations (with laborer positions common among the men), access to PA sites, the farming/herding of animals, and the lack of transportation. All of these factors support the high reported walking (intensity, 3.3 METs) and the frequency and time spent in aerobic activity. The literature also supports high levels of walking in NAs, with one study reporting it in 44% of subjects (13). In this NA population, some of the participants walked 4 miles round trip to the store or chapter house, walked during their 12-h work shifts at the casinos, or walked as part of their ranching activities. The participant\u2019s gait speed could vary among these walking activities as well. In terms of occupations that require walking and other physical labor, it has been shown that in both Alaskan NA men and women, about 45% or more have previously reported participating in two or more traditional harvesting activities (24).\n\nThe use of a self-report instrument to assess the PA patterns in these adults is one limitation of this study, as overestimation of activity can occur with the self-report method. In the IPAQ-SF, changes were made to be culturally relevant to the NA population (16). However, it should be noted that the IPAQ-SF questionnaire did not assess types or modalities of activity separately, or planned versus unplanned activities, but rather gave examples of activities that fit into the intensity levels of moderate activity (4.0 METs) and vigorous activity (8.0 METs). The lowest intensity was walking at 3.3 METs. The other intensities were described to the participant as those that \u201cmake you breathe much harder than normal\u201d for vigorous, including activities such as heavy lifting, digging, running, or shoveling snow. For moderate intensity, the description included activities such as carrying light loads, yard work, house cleaning, or bicycling at a regular pace. Thus, this instrument contains a \u201cwalking\u201d intensity that would correspond to a lower heart rate than moderate and vigorous intensity. Depending on whether the participant understands how to and correctly delineates between these intensities would affect at what intensity an activity is self-reported. In addition, the interviewer for the majority of the participants translated the questions to the native language (Athabascan) and provided scenarios to aid the participants. For example, intensity was described as how hard the exertion was, as well as the person\u2019s physical response (sweating, elevated heart rate, etc.). The interviewer also asked questions such as \u201cDo you chop wood at home and sweat?\u201d These variations in daily activities that elicit a long duration of exertion and high heart rates and are a part of the NA\u2019s daily life may influence the results, and the time and intensity components of the FITT-V model. Future research is needed to better understand both of these components in this population.\n\nIn this study, 71.2% of men and 77.3% of women met the weekly requirement for PA. This is much higher than has been previously reported in NA adults (11,13,26). Interestingly, when asked about what the participants would do if they had free time, the majority reported \u201cwalking.\u201d Therefore, according to the self-report, the activity levels on the IPAQ-SF are ordinary behaviors of these participants who also report active behaviors during free time. The difference in the volume or quantity of activity was significantly different between the men and women who met the weekly PA requirement. The MET-minutes is an index of energy expenditure, and therefore, the men are expending a higher energy expenditure per week than the women. Epidemiological and clinical trials have documented the dose\u2013response association between the volume of exercise and health/fitness outcomes (10,26,27). A target volume of 500\u20131000 MET-min\u00b7wk\u22121 has been recommended as acceptable (10,27). In this NA sample, the mean volume exceeds this in both men and women; however, caution should be introduced here because of the very wide variability in the sample and the mismatch between the self-reported high levels of PA and the participant characteristics (high BMI, smoking status, and percent of sample with hypertension). Both the men and the women in this sample have high levels of obesity, as only 15% of the sample is normal weight. Interventions such as OPREVENT2 (19) are needed to improve both energy expenditure and alter the energy intake/diet composition in this population.\n\nReports from the US Department of Health and Human Services breaks down the PA guidelines for adults engaging in no leisure-time PA, minimum aerobic PA, high aerobic PA, and interestingly, adults meeting muscle-strengthening activities as \u22652 d\u00b7wk\u22121. The IPAQ did not capture this directly; therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the men and women in this NA sample met the recommended level of PA for muscle strengthening activities. The questionnaire did not specifically address flexibility or neuromotor exercise, and therefore, it is unknown if this sample of NA adults participated in these activities. It would be interesting to gather information on other activities that influence balance, proprioception, agility, gait, coordination, and muscular endurance. These activities are necessary for health and wellness. Future studies should develop culturally appropriate questions to enhance the assessment for these other types of activities.\n\nIn conclusion, this sample of NA adults reported adequate walking and in the men, a greater volume of activity compared with the women. Given that the majority of NA report adequate walking time and frequency, interventions are needed to improve moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic fitness, as well as muscular strength and endurance, neuromotor, and flexibility activities.\n\nFunding for this study was provided by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (R01HL 122150). The authors would like to acknowledge the following individuals and organizations for their substantial contributions to the development and implementation of this study and manuscript: all communities participating in OPREVENT2 and individuals in the intervention sample. Trained data collectors were Mary Dubek and Laurie in WI, and Harrison Platero, Elverna Bennett, Tenley Vigil, and Felicia Sectiono in NM. Field project coordinators were Jacqueline Swartz in WI and Marla Pardilla in NM.\n\nThe authors declare there are no conflicts of interest. The results of the present study do not constitute an endorsement by the American College of Sports Medicine.\n\n**REFERENCES**\n1.

Founded in 1998, the Informing Science Institute (ISI) is a global community of academics shaping the future of informing science.\n\n**Aim/Purpose:** This paper provides the results of the preliminary analysis of the findings of an ongoing study that seeks to examine the social media use, cultural and political awareness, civic engagement, issue prioritization, and social activism of Gen Z students enrolled at four different institutional types located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The aim of this study is to look at the group as a whole as well as compare findings across populations. The institutional types under consideration include a mid-sized majority serving or otherwise referred to as a traditionally white institution (TWI) located in a small coastal city on the Atlantic Ocean, a small Historically Black University (HBCU) located in a rural area, a large community college located in a county that is a mixture of rural and suburban and which sits on the border of Maryland and Pennsylvania, and graduating high school students enrolled in career and technical education (CTE) programs in a large urban area. This exploration is purposed to examine the behaviors and expectations of Gen Z students within a representative American region during a time of tremendous turmoil and civil unrest in the United States.\n\n**Background:** Over 74 million strong, Gen Z makes up almost one-quarter of the U.S. population. They already outnumber any current living generation and are the first true digital natives. Born after 1996 and through 2012, they are known for their short attention spans and heightened ability to multi-task. Raised in the age of the smart phone, they have been tethered to digital devices from a young age with most having the preponderance of their childhood milestones commemorated online. Often called Zoomers, they are more racially and ethnically diverse than any previous generation and are on track to be the most well-educated generation in history. Gen Zers in the United States have been found in the research to be progressive and pro-government and viewing increasing racial and ethnic diversity as positive change. Finally, they are less likely to hold xenophobic beliefs such as the notion of American exceptionalism and superiority that have been popular with by prior generations.\nThe United States has been in a period of social and civil unrest in recent years with concerns over systematic racism, rampant inequalities, political polarization, xenophobia, police violence, sexual assault and harassment, and the growing epidemic of gun violence. Anxieties stirred by the COVID-19 pandemic further compounded these issues resulting in a powder keg explosion occurring throughout the summer of 2020 and leading well into 2021. As a result, the United States has deteriorated significantly in the Civil Unrest Index falling from 91st to 34th. \nThe vitriol, polarization, protests, murders, and shootings have all occurred during Gen Z\u2019s formative years, and the limited research available indicates that it has shaped their values and political views.\n\n**Methodology:** The Mid-Atlantic region is a portion of the United States that exists as the overlap between the northeastern and southeastern portions of the country. It includes the nation\u2019s capital, as well as large urban centers, small cities, suburbs, and rural enclaves. It is one of the most socially, economically, racially, and culturally diverse parts of the United States and is often referred to as the \u201ctypically American region.\u201d \nAn electronic survey was administered to students from 2019 through 2021 attending a high school dual enrollment program, a minority serving institution, a majority serving institution, and a community college all located within the larger mid-Atlantic region. The survey included a combination of multiple response, Likert scaled, dichotomous, open ended, and ordinal questions. It was developed in the Survey Monkey system and reviewed by several content and methodological experts in order to examine bias, vagueness, or potential semantic problems. Finally, the survey was pilot tested prior to implementation in order to explore the efficacy of the research methodology. It was then modified accordingly prior to widespread distribution to potential participants.\nThe surveys were administered to students enrolled in classes taught by the authors all of whom are educators. Participation was voluntary, optional, and anonymous. Over 800 individuals completed the survey with just over 700 usable results, after partial completes and the responses of individuals outside of the 18-24 age range were removed. \n\n**Findings:** Participants in this study overwhelmingly were users of social media. In descending order, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, WhatsApp, LinkedIn and Tik Tok were the most popular social media services reported as being used. When volume of use was considered, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Twitter were the most cited with most participants reporting using Instagram and Snapchat multiple times a day.\nWhen asked to select which social media service they would use if forced to choose just one, the number one choice was YouTube followed by Instagram and Snapchat. Additionally, more than half of participants responded that they have uploaded a video to a video sharing site such as YouTube or Tik Tok. \nWhen asked about their familiarity with different technologies, participants overwhelmingly responded that they are \u201cvery familiar\u201d with smart phones, searching the Web, social media, and email. About half the respondents said that they were \u201cvery familiar\u201d with common computer applications such as the Microsoft Office Suite or Google Suite with another third saying that they were \u201csomewhat familiar.\u201d When asked about Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Blackboard, Course Compass, Canvas, Edmodo, Moodle, Course Sites, Google Classroom, Mindtap, Schoology, Absorb, D2L, itslearning, Otus, PowerSchool, or WizIQ, only 43% said they were \u201cvery familiar\u201d with 31% responding that they were \u201csomewhat familiar.\u201d Finally, about half the students were either \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d familiar with operating systems such as Windows.\nA few preferences with respect to technology in the teaching and learning process were explored in the survey. Most students (85%) responded that they want course announcements and reminders sent to their phones, 76% expect their courses to incorporate the use of technology, 71% want their courses to have course websites, and 71% said that they would rather watch a video than read a book chapter. \nWhen asked to consider the future, over 81% or respondents reported that technology will play a major role in their future career. \nMost participants considered themselves \u201cinformed\u201d or \u201cwell informed\u201d about current events although few considered themselves \u201cvery informed\u201d or \u201cwell informed\u201d about politics. When asked how they get their news, the most common forum reported for getting news and information about current events and politics was social media with 81% of respondents reporting. \nGen Z is known to be an engaged generation and the participants in this study were not an exception. As such, it came as no surprise to discover that, in the past year more than 78% of respondents had educated friends or family about an important social or political issue, about half (48%) had donated to a cause of importance to them, more than a quarter (26%) had participated in a march or rally, and a quarter (26%) had actively boycotted a product or company. Further, about 37% consider themselves to be a social activist with another 41% responding that they aren\u2019t sure if they would consider themselves an activist and only 22% saying that they would not consider themselves an activist.\nWhen asked what issues were important to them, the most frequently cited were Black Lives Matter (75%), human trafficking (68%), sexual assault/harassment/Me Too (66.49%), gun violence (65.82%), women\u2019s rights (65.15%), climate change (55.4%), immigration reform/deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA) (48.8%), and LGBTQ+ rights (47.39%).\nWhen the schools were compared, there were only minor differences in social media use with the high school students indicating slightly more use of Tik Tok than the other participants. All groups were virtually equal when it came to how informed they perceived themselves about current events and politics. Consensus among groups existed with respect to how they get their news, and the community college and high school students were slightly more likely to have participated in a march, protest, or rally in the last 12 months than the university students. The community college and high school students were also slightly more likely to consider themselves social activists than the participants from either of the universities.  \nWhen the importance of the issues was considered, significant differences based on institutional type were noted. \nBlack Lives Matter (BLM) was identified as important by the largest portion of students attending the HBCU followed by the community college students and high school students. Less than half of the students attending the TWI considered BLM an important issue. Human trafficking was cited as important by a higher percentage of students attending the HBCU and urban high school than at the suburban and rural community college or the TWI. Sexual assault was considered important by the majority of students at all the schools with the percentage a bit smaller from the majority serving institution. About two thirds of the students at the high school, community college, and HBCU considered gun violence important versus about half the students at the majority serving institution. Women\u2019s rights were reported as being important by more of the high school and HBCU participants than the community college or TWI. Climate change was considered important by about half the students at all schools with a slightly smaller portion reporting out the HBCU. Immigration reform/DACA was reported as important by half the high school, community college, and HBCU participants with only a third of the students from the majority serving institution citing it as an important issue. With respect to LGBTQ rights approximately half of the high school and community college participants cited it as important, 44.53% of the HBCU students, and only about a quarter of the students attending the majority serving institution.   \n\n**Contribution and Conclusion:** This paper provides a timely investigation into the mindset of generation Z students living in the United States during a period of heightened civic unrest. This insight is useful to educators who should be informed about the generation of students that is currently populating higher education. \nThe findings of this study are consistent with public opinion polls by Pew Research Center. According to the findings, the Gen Z students participating in this study are heavy users of multiple social media, expect technology to be integrated into teaching and learning, anticipate a future career where technology will play an important role, informed about current and political events, use social media as their main source for getting news and information, and fairly engaged in social activism. When institutional type was compared the students from the university with the more affluent and less diverse population were less likely to find social justice issues important than the other groups.\n\n**Recommendations for Practitioners:** During disruptive and contentious times, it is negligent to think that the abounding issues plaguing society are not important to our students. Gauging the issues of importance and levels of civic engagement provides us crucial information towards understanding the attitudes of students. Further, knowing how our students gain information, their social media usage, as well as how informed they are about current events and political issues can be used to more effectively communicate and educate.\n\n**Recommendations for Researchers:** As social media continues to proliferate daily life and become a vital means of news and information gathering, additional studies such as the one presented here are needed. Additionally, in other countries facing similarly turbulent times, measuring student interest, awareness, and engagement is highly informative.\n\n**Impact on Society:** During a highly contentious period replete with a large volume of civil unrest and compounded by a global pandemic, understanding the behaviors and attitudes of students can help us as higher education faculty be more attuned when it comes to the design and delivery of curriculum.\n**Future Research:** This presentation presents preliminary findings. Data is still being collected and much more extensive statistical analyses will be performed.", "extra_context": {"keywords": ["Gen Z", "social media", "civic engagement", "cultural awareness", "political awareness", "activism"], "authors": ["Not specified"], "date": "Not specified", "journal": "Not specified", "note": "No specific authors, dates or journal details provided."}}, {"abstract": "Beyond Social Distance: The Cultural and Digital Divide at an HBCU\n\nAbstract: COVID-19 forced abrupt shifts to e-learning, deepened an existing digital divide at a mid-Atlantic Historically Black College/University (HBCU), and exacerbated perennial inequity issues at HBCUs. The campus community was ill-prepared to navigate remotely due to unreliable internet service, insufficient technology, and shared spaces that were not optimal for teaching and learning. Work-life imbalances threatened the well-being of students, staff, and faculty who struggled to meet academic and professional demands amid homeschooling, caregiving, and coping with COVID-19 fatalities.

As citizens and policymakers respond to these challenges, American democracy and societies worldwide are at a crossroads. In How Democracies Die, Levitsky and Ziblatt (Citation2018) asserted that \u201cAmerican democracy depends on us \u2013 the citizens of the United States. No single political leader can end a democracy; no single leader can rescue one, either\u201d (p. 230). Can we meet this challenge of shared civic responsibilities in a highly polarized polity? Do our schools and other core institutions have the capacity and the will to inspire our children and young adults\u2019 civility and civic purpose? Can we revive civic trust as the majority of our citizens lose confidence in our governing institutions? Will the next generation of American citizens be ready to exercise their voting rights and free speech? Will inequalities in civic engagement widen in the context of growing economic inequality? Is deliberative democracy fading in the American polity? These issues are at the core of the design, practice, and future of democratic practices in the United States and beyond. The papers in this special issue raise the saliency and the relevance of these issues while suggesting steps that civic actors \u2013 whether teachers, researchers, students, parents, taxpayers, or other members of the public \u2013 can and do take to encourage greater democratic living.\n\nThe worrisome state of American democracy calls for a systematic examination of civic education and civic capacity, the foundational pillars of democratic life. Mounk (Citation2018) found that only one-third of millennials (versus two-thirds of those born in the 1930s and 1940s) thought living in a democratic society was very important. Studies (e.g., CCSSO, Citation2018) show curricula are narrowing due to high stakes accountability, often excluding or marginalizing civics education. Schools can play an important role in increasing civic engagement generally and decreasing gaps in civic engagement that exist (Levinson, Citation2012), but civic opportunities are often inequitably distributed within schools (Kahne & Middaugh, Citation2008).\n\nIn a political context shifting toward ideological polarization (Feldman et al., Citation2018) and populism (Roth, Citation2017) and away from transparent and public accountability around the globe, including in democracies, there is increasing interest in reaffirming democratic practices. In the US, part of the rationale for public schools has been to prepare people to be democratic citizens, both historically (Dewey, Citation1916) and currently (Gould et al., Citation2011). Given the longstanding commitment to civic education and the current urgency, this special issue offers a comprehensive, current understanding of the state of the field.\n\nCollectively, this special issue integrates theoretical and empirical work on civic education, civic capacity, and democratic practices. We view civic education as a set of learning goals shaped by the framework of liberal democracy (e.g., Dewey, Citation1916; Gutmann, Citation1987). Particular attention is given to the concepts and practice of action civics, a type of guided experiential civics education (Ballard et al., Citation2016; Cohen et al., Citation2018; Pope et al., Citation2011). Strengthening civic education will contribute to vibrant civic capacity, a concept commonly promoted by political scientists (e.g., Henig et al., Citation1999; Orr & Rogers, Citation2011; Putnam, Citation2000; Skocpol, Citation2003; Stone et al., Citation2001). Civic capacity departs from business-as-usual politics and fosters cross-sector collaboration to address a common challenge at the system-wide level. Examining the connection between civic education and civic capacity highlights inequalities in civic learning and the extent to which educational inadequacy may affect civic engagement, such as electoral turnouts and parental involvement in schooling issues (Orr et al., Citation2016).\n\nThis special issue examines these topics as they relate to issues across a range of settings in the US and internationally. Our authors report on work being done at scale with diverse populations and address issues that are particularly relevant to education policy, politics, capacity building, and practice. Our first paper, by Fitzgerald et al. (Citation2021), offers a systematic review of the last decade of civics education research in the United States. Of the 648 studies reviewed, almost 70% focused on civic curricula, instructional practices, and learning outcomes. Civic skills and capacities and civic identities accounted for only 19% and 14% of the studies respectively. The authors found very few studies that incorporated marginalized voices in politics and addressed increasing political polarization. The paper identifies directions for future research that could support efforts to broaden youth civic participation and decrease political polarization.\n\nThe next several papers in the issue focus on civic education and democratic practices in schools. In the United States, Littenberg-Tobias (Citation2021) explores relationships between active learning in civics and students\u2019 civic knowledge using NAEP civics data. He found that active learning experiences were positively associated with increases in student knowledge, but the overall effect sizes were fairly small. However, after applying a different method for measuring active learning that emphasized quality not quantity of experience and taking into account potential overuse of activities, the effect size was substantially larger.\n\nDiGiacomo et al. (Citation2021) studied teachers\u2019 civic education experiences and perspectives in a politically and demographically diverse school district. How teachers conceptualized civic education varied widely, from preparing students to be critical thinkers, to teaching how to be good \u201ccitizens,\u201d to showing them how to exercise their voice in civic activities. Sociopolitical contexts and other external challenges shaped how teachers integrated civics into their classes and classroom practices. Importantly, while teachers felt strongly about supporting students\u2019 civic development, they lacked systematic support for doing so routinely.\n\nSome papers explored nonprofits\u2019 work on civic education. McAvoy and McAvoy (Citation2021) studied the Close Up Washington program and reported on the differential polarization of high school students who experience political discussion in deliberative small groups versus debate activities and offer ideas for reducing polarization. The lessons about how discussion strategies impact student polarization are especially important for teachers who engage controversial or contentious issues in what can be already polarized classrooms.\n\nAndes et al. (Citation2021) reflect on over a decade of Generation Citizen\u2019s school-based programming, highlighting three important qualities for a successful nonpartisan program: local focus, diversity, and community and student voice. Their attention to being political in a nonpartisan way is particularly important for pedagogical approaches like action civics, which encourage student voice, agency, and action. This can inform the future of action civics education in schools, regardless of the political leanings of the school\u2019s area.\n\nDrawing on anti-racist theory and the knowledge base on community organizing, Kirshner et al. (Citation2021) propose a framework for scaling and sustaining justice-centered civic learning. Their theory of change is illuminated by an initiative sponsored by the Denver Public Schools that raised the awareness of students and teachers on injustices and broadened student engagement in action research and policy change. Among the facilitating features on critical civic engagement included teacher buy-in, organizational and content alignment, and student leadership development. Lessons learned from this case study have implications for moving action civics beyond merely a checklist.\n\nThe issue also includes research from Cuba and Israel. Dawley-Carr (Citation2021) explores Cuba\u2019s K-12 citizenship education model and its current challenges. Historically, Cuban citizenship education, from its organizational structure to its civics curriculum, emphasized work in the planned economy as a central civic duty. With emerging privatization, today\u2019s Cuban youth face challenges to meeting this duty. The paper offers in-depth case studies of youth whose lived experiences showed varying educational and vocational pathways with shifting civic mindedness.\n\nCohen and Eyal (Citation2021) study cross-sector alliances \u2013 partnerships between public schools and groups outside the formal education system \u2013 in Israeli high school civics courses. Interviews with teachers engaged in such partnerships yield valuable insights into how the civic ideology of outside groups intersects with and influences ideas of citizenship presented in classrooms. Cohen and Eyal warn of the potential for cross-sector alliances to reify particular, dominant conceptions of citizenship at the potential expense of marginalized groups.\n\nWe conclude with papers focused on civic capacity and democratic practices in school districts. Morel (Citation2021) outlines how civic engagement and the politics of citizenship helped transform the public schools in Union City, New Jersey. He notes that the unique political constituency of Cuban Americans at a time that the state was led by Republicans (who were interested in Cuban Americans as potential Republican voters) offered the school district more flexibility in improving their school system than other districts, which led to sustained improvements. As polarization and politicization worsen across societies, it will be important to put politics aside (and not rely on state politicians deciding that there is political alignment) in order to support community engagement in school system transformation.\n\nCollins (Citation2021) brings nuanced findings to an important question: Who should be in charge of schools? Through a novel video-based survey experiment, Collins questions the otherwise straightforward finding that stakeholders generally prefer school boards over other forms of control such as school-site councils or state and federal bodies. He offers important clarifications about what kind of stakeholder prefers school boards. He also explores evidence and implications of stakeholder desires to engage with school boards directly. School stakeholders want opportunities for community members to engage in the deliberative democratic practice of school board decisions. This finding bodes well for broader efforts to promote democratic practice across the landscape of public schools.\n\nEach article offers an important contribution to the field of civics education at a time when popular discourse around civics, citizenship, and democracy more generally seems despondent. Concerns of polarization, the lack of constructive discourse, and increasing isolation inside partisan \u201cecho chambers\u201d have been particularly visible in recent years and concern all of us who are committed to the tenets of democracy and the practice of democratic education. We invite readers to approach each article as an exploration of a particular piece of this larger challenge and hope that readers will engage with the ideas as they exist across and between the separate pieces. There is no single approach that will safeguard the future of civic education and democratic living. Instead, educators at every level must be prepared with the tools and dispositions to support a broad approach to this work.\n\nThree themes across this issue reveal both immediate classroom needs and future goals for educators and researchers: equity, polarization, and the role of curricula and pedagogy in promoting citizenship and civic action. These themes highlight the importance of schools as spaces for developing and practicing democracy in ways that can impact broader communities.\n\nMany of these articles share an interest in issues of equity, and the different experiences marginalized students may have both as students and civic actors. Working toward equity will include ensuring that all students have equitable access to high-quality civics education in schools and that they also have equitable access to civic engagement opportunities and civic power beyond school as well. As the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated many inequities, including gaps in what educational opportunities youth experience, it will be important to closely monitor equity in civic education, civic capacity, and civic life.\n\nSchools can respond to the realities of polarization in national politics, and can also model consensus building, compromise and learning across differences, and be part of the solution toward reducing political polarization. Can schools provide a safe space where ideas on democracy and governance can be debated without repercussions? Will schools teach students how to earn respect and be respected when political discourse occurs? Addressing these issues in our schools will have broad ramifications for our next generation of leaders.\n\nWhether implicit or explicit, teachers offer certain ideas about citizenship as they craft curricula and/or as they transform provided curricula into enacted classroom activities. The pedagogies of citizenship can enable classrooms to serve as important sites for dialogues and deliberations about what democracy means and what democratic participation entails. While we agree that schools are the appropriate venue for such dialogues, we are also mindful of ongoing debates regarding not just types of citizenship, but the ways in which curricula open or close discussions of the relationships between teacher, student, and state. We hope, too, that future research will investigate those relationships as they move outside of the classroom, to interrogate the practices of deliberative democracy and voting beyond the school.\n\nWe are at a critical juncture: This decade will be formative for supporting democratic responses to overcoming the sizable challenges, including widening inequities, that have emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. Promoting collaborative (versus polarized), equitable civic participation to sustain societies is essential.", "extra_context": {"authors": ["Alison K. Cohen", "Alexander Pope IV", "Kenneth K.

We investigated the influence of food availability, predation risk, and the perceived predation risk on habitat use by a primate living under high hunting pressure, the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys, Sapajus xanthosternos, at Una Biological Reserve (ReBio Una). We hypothesized that the hunting pressure occurring in the capuchins' home range would favor predator avoidance to the detriment of searching for food. We characterized a set of covariates related to resource availability (fruit and invertebrate biomasses, feeding on dispersed and clumped food items, sleeping sites), perceived predation risk (alarm calls given to terrestrial and aerial predators, silent group movement, and vigilance behavior), and actual predation risk (evidence of hunting) and estimated their effects on how one group of capuchin monkeys uses its habitat. The group divides its time among three major forest types within their home range: agroforest, mature, and secondary. Our results suggest that the actual and perceived risk of hunting by humans, as well as the perceived predation risk by both terrestrial and aerial predators, were significant determinants of capuchin monkeys' space use. Yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys' space use was negatively related to the risk of hunting by humans (actual evidence and silent behavior), the perceived risk of predation by both aerial and terrestrial predators, and the presence of sleeping sites. Capuchin monkeys' use of space was not related to the biomass of fruits in the habitat, and the biomass of invertebrates had a very low positive effect. We confirmed our prediction that in a habitat with high hunting pressure, the risk of predation, both perceived and actual, had a more significant impact on how yellow-breasted capuchins used space than did food availability.\n\n## Research Highlights\n- Hunting by humans increases the perceived risk of predation by capuchins.\n- Landscape of fear, mainly of hunting, affected the habitat use by capuchins.\n- Habitat choices were influenced more by perceived predation risk than by food availability.\n\n## Conflict of Interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.\n\n## Data Availability Statement\nThe data set analyzed during the current study are available from Salisbury University (https://mdsoar.org/submit?workspaceID=19888).\n\n## Supporting Information\nFilename: ajp23243-sup-0001-Suscke_et_al_SupportingInformation.docx\nDescription: Supporting information.", "extra_context": {"keywords": ["predation risk", "habitat use", "food availability", "hunting pressure"], "authors": ["Priscila Suscke", "Andrea Presotto", "Patr\u00edcia Izar"], "date": "2021-03-23", "journal": "American Journal of Primatology", "volume": "83", "issue": "5", "doi": "10.1002/ajp.23243"}}, {"abstract": "ABSTRACTIn today\u2019s increasingly volatile world, organisations including healthcare providers need interfirm dynamic capabilities to make timely responses to supply chains changes.

The results indicated that the area most suitable for fish cages comprised about 362 km\u00b2, or approximately 9% of the total area; the remaining 91% (i.e., 3,737 km\u00b2) was found to be unsuitable for tilapia cage culture. We conclude that the successful implementation of this approach would need stakeholder involvement in the validation and approval of potential sites, and in the incorporation of lake zoning into spatial planning policy and the regulations that support sustainable use while minimising resource use conflicts. The results of this study have broader applicability to the whole of Lake Victoria, other African Great Lakes, and any lakes in the world where tilapia cage culture already occurs or may occur in the future.", "extra_context": {"authors": ["Christopher Mulanda Aura", "Safina Musa", "Chrisphine S.

Today there is a wide body of empirical evidence that demonstrates partnering benefits outweigh the resources devoted to its implementation. Despite such outstanding outcomes, collaborative partnering is still new, misunderstood, underutilized, and evolving for airport construction projects that entail greater complexity and increased risks due to a high number of stakeholders and additional sector-specific regulations. The objectives of this study are to describe the state-of-practice regarding partnering in the aviation construction industry and offer insights about its use. A comprehensive survey of industry professionals representing DOTs, airports, and others involved in construction aviation projects in the United States helps capture partnering trends across the industry. Findings show that participants with experience in partnered-aviation construction projects perceive higher improvement of safety and reduced claims offering greater rewards. However, these projects are operating as late adopters of partnering with many at the initial stages of implementation. The main contribution of the paper to the body of knowledge is that partnering is suitable for airport projects regardless of the project delivery method followed, budget size, or partnering intensity levels. Those with greater experience with partnering under design-bid-build project delivery methods are more likely to perceive higher improvements. Furthermore, it increases trust and strengthens the relationships between organizations. The findings are significant as they bring attention to team integration practices for improved outcomes via the underutilized partnering in an industry niche where stakeholder and risk management are key to project success.\n\n### Acknowledgments\nThe authors extend their sincere gratitude to the numerous industry professionals who contributed to the study with data and insights.

A balance between erosion and deposition in a restored salt marsh is crucial for analyzing restoration strategies to be adopted within a natural context. Marsh morphology is also coupled with tidal mudflats and channel networks and this makes micro-tidal systems crucial for a detailed assessment of restoration interventions. Here, we present a methodological approach for monitoring channel morphodynamics and vegetation variations over a time frame of six years in a low tidal energy salt marsh of the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island (Maryland, USA). The project is a restoration site where sediment dredged from the shipping channels in the upper Chesapeake Bay is used to restore a tidal marsh habitat in mid-Chesapeake Bay. Aerial surveys with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) have been performed for the high-resolution mapping of a small tidal system. Flight missions were planned to obtain a Ground Sample Distance (GSD) of 2 cm. Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) algorithms have been used to reconstruct the 3D geometry of the site. The mapping of channel morphology and an elevation assessment on the mudflat were performed using orthomosaics, Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) and GNSS survey. The results highlight that the workflow adopted in this pilot work is suitable to assess the geomorphological evolution over time in a micro-tidal system. However, issues were encountered for salt marsh due to the presence of dense vegetation. The UAV-based photogrammetry approach with GNSS RTK ground surveys can hence be replicated in similar sites all over the world to evaluate restoration interventions and to develop new strategies for a better management of existing shorelines.\n\nKeywords: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV); salt marsh restoration; micro-tidal system; high-resolution monitoring; coastal geomorphology\n\n1. Introduction\nThe impact of human activities combined with meteorological events such as hurricanes and storm surges or sea level rise (SLR) affects the sediment fluxes of coastal regions in a significant manner. The presence of vegetation along the shoreline contributes in mitigating erosion of the most impacted areas. In fact, such erosion is mainly caused by a high shear stress on the bottom of un-vegetated tidal creeks, often associated with extreme events. The friction of dense vegetation reduces erosion, particularly when the tides are elevated, and the drag created by 2 m-tall marsh plants can be critical in slowing currents. However, the factors mentioned above also impact on the capability of vegetated salt marshes to survive climate change. Due to the important role of coastal wetlands in impacting the sediment transport and surface elevation of the marsh, the restoration of salt marshes has been of interest since at least 1988. Primarily, the resilience of salt marshes to climate change is important to develop interventions able to mitigate the impact of extreme, and even catastrophic, events, as well as to understand the evolution of coastal regions and to assess their morphological changes. The preservation of the existing marshes and the restoration of the lost ones contribute to limiting land loss in many coastal regions and ensuring the valuable estuarine and coastal ecosystem services. Moreover, the coupling between tidal mudflats and salt marshes affects the marsh morphology, as well as the efficiency of tidal channel networks can alleviate aspects such as the drought-induced die-off of salt marshes. This highlights the importance of micro-tidal systems in which salt marshes, mudflats and channel networks can be studied simultaneously. The Eastern Shore of Maryland, facing the Chesapeake Bay, is currently one of the most impacted areas by SLR along the whole East Coast of the United States. SLR also affects coastal processes in many parts of the Bay and the entire region has been subjected to coastal erosion during the last decades. In particular, waves impact marsh boundaries at higher elevation enhancing erosional processes. Extreme events, such as hurricanes, winter storms and strong Nor\u2019easter winds, can cause very large water level excursions (up to some meters). This implies that flood and ebb currents have the strength to magnify the erosion processes caused by ordinary tidal cycles, while, on the other side, it also means that increased wave erosion associated with stronger winds can impact wider areas, since the changing water level causes the waves to break in different zones. In addition, sediment resuspension and transport during tropical storms and Nor\u2019easter could represent a significant term in the sedimentary budget of an estuary. CB is also subjected to subsidence: for an Absolute Sea Level Rise (ASLR) rate of 1.81.8 mm/yr at late 20th/early 21st century, inferred subsidence rates vary from \u22124.00 mm/yr at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel, VA, to \u22121.29 mm/yr at Baltimore, MD.\n\nPoplar Island, located in the upper-middle CB, was almost completely lost because of both the erosion and the combination of sea level rise and subsidence. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)\u2013Baltimore District in collaboration with the Maryland Department of Transportation\u2013Maryland Port Administration (MDOT MPA) and in cooperation with Maryland Environmental Service (MES) have established a project focused on restoring the original extent of Poplar Island. The uppermost eastern part of the island is divided into three cells respectively named 1A, 1B and 1C from south to north. The three cells constitute an overall tidal system with water exchange between adjacent cells. In addition, each cell has its own culvert providing a link with CB. The channel morphology of the cells has been planned studying the channel geometry, tidal dynamics and marsh surface elevation, since marsh morphology depends on different factors such as the relationship between tidal mudflats and salt marshes. Two natural marshes (Hog Island and Chesapeake Bay Environmental Center) were used as a reference for the design of channel morphology in the Poplar Island marshes. Assessing the variation occurred in time, in terms of natural evolution of the initial design of the cell, is important for understanding the actual impact of restoration strategy adopted for mitigating the erosion of shorelines. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature to evaluate and analyze shoreline changes. The use of satellite images is suitable for large areas and advanced techniques such as a cluster-based segmentation may be applied. However, the accurate detection of small systems requires high resolutions with a Ground Sample Distance (GSD) of a few centimeters. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) represent primary tools in order to both detecting and characterizing morphology of such systems. Different techniques exist for collecting data for DEM generation: (i) direct ground point surveys, (ii) Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), (iii) aerial Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) systems and (iv) aerial photogrammetry from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Direct methods are very time-consuming: requires the survey of each point of interest, whereas implies post-processing operations to aligning and registering point clouds with the additional task of a data filtering. Aerial LiDAR is similar to, essentially with the difference of a non-terrestrial data acquisition. UAV photogrammetry combines the flexibility of drones in carrying almost every kind of device, in particular cameras, with the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) approach that allows one to reconstruct the 3D geometry of objects. The density of photogrammetric dense point clouds is comparable to the one of TLS and LiDAR and the high spatial resolution is also matched by high model accuracy. For such reasons, UAV photogrammetry has been widely and successfully used in a multitude of applications: coastal environments, such as the monitoring of dune systems and beach topography, river morphology characterization, assessment of glacier dynamics, landslide monitoring and also architectural heritage. The high level of accuracy achievable with DEMs derived from UAV imageries has been investigated and confirmed, as well as the reproducibility of the results. In this work, we present the use of UAV photogrammetry for assessing the behavior of a micro-tidal system in terms of evolution, with regard to the restored salt marsh, the mudflat and the channel network. In fact, the potential of UAVs for monitoring the morphodynamics of mudflats has been investigated by Jaud et al. in the Seine Estuary, finding out that UAV datasets enable, for instance, multi-scale approaches, but a complete micro-tidal system has not been investigated yet. In particular, the methodology proposed here has been applied focusing on a small cell (Cell 1B, abbreviated as C\u20131B in the following), which is located in the middle of the overall tidal system described above and hence C\u20131B is connected with both Cells 1A and 1C. In fact, C\u20131B experiences all of the dynamics of CB shorelines. For instance, between March 2 and 10 March 2018 Winter Storm Riley caused a water level range of up to 2 m. This was recorded by tide gauges in Cambridge along the Choptank River and in Annapolis. Both the tide gauges are about 30 km away from Poplar Island. Considering that the total (maximum) predicted tidal range during the winter storm (without storm effects) is approximately 0.7 m, this was a typical Nor\u2019easter. In order to evaluate the evolution of the cell under SLR and meteorological events, a monitoring over time has therefore been started.\n\nThe aim of the proposed study is to apply a simple and flexible survey procedure to help and improve tidal system monitoring, also for providing basis for high-resolution numerical modeling of small tidal systems, exploring the potential of UAVs in this field. Moreover, the study site selected for the methodology development is one of the first worldwide restoration project where an interdisciplinary marsh design has been tested. Due to the small size of both the restoration project and the features of interest, traditional satellite remote sensing (e.g., Landsat 8, Sentinel 2 imagery) does not have a sufficient ground resolution and an innovative monitoring method is needed for tracking geomorphological and ecological changes on a short time scale and with a quick time frame. Originality consists of applying this approach to a small cell (micro-tidal system) in order to assess the evolution over time investigating the feasibility of the overall procedure and evaluating the actual level of accuracy attainable.", "extra_context": {"authors": ["Yuri Taddia", "Alberto Pellegrinelli", "Corinne Corbau", "Giulia Franchi", "Lorie W.

To explore this potential construct, this study used an exploratory, qualitative research design. This study explored grit at the organizational level by interviewing leaders\u2019 perceptions of what may be a culture of organizational grit. Participants included 14 U.S. military officers. Seven themes emerged relative to the research question: \u201cWhat do U.S. military officers perceive as a culture of organizational grit?\u201d Themes included professional pride, team unity, resilience-determination, mission accomplishment, core values, growth mindset, and deliberate practice. This study indicated that a culture of organizational grit is likely a combination of converging organizational elements. Overall, findings indicate that there may be a culture of organizational grit in the military and at the least, more research examining the concept is warranted.\n\nGet full access to this article\n\nView all access and purchase options for this article.\n\nReferences\nAguinis H., Boyd B.

A balance between marsh erosion and deposition in a restored tidal wetland is crucial for analyzing restoration strategies to adopt in a natural context. Here, we present an integrated approach monitoring salt marsh seasonal changes over several months in a microtidal restored salt marsh of the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island (MD, USA). The project is undertaken at a restoration site where sediment dredged from the shipping channels in the upper Chesapeake Bay is being used to restore a tidal marsh habitat in mid-Chesapeake Bay. We flew an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with an RGB and a multispectral camera to obtain a high-resolution map of the planimetric position of vegetation and to monitor the health of the marsh vegetation in diverse seasons. Due to its extension of 400 m by 400 m, a total of four flight plans were necessary to cover the entire marsh flying at a 40 m altitude obtaining a 2 cm Ground Sample Distance (GSD). This technique provides reliable results at a very low cost, enabling an accurate assessment of the marsh platforms to be conducted over time, due to both the very high spatial resolution and the precise georeferencing of the images for the comparisons. Our results show seasonal variability in the two dominant species colonizing the low marsh, Spartina alterniflora, and high marsh, Sporobolus pumilus. While the lower marshes showed a higher variability along seasons, the up-land vegetation showed persistent green foliage during cold seasons. Detecting salt marsh evolution and seasonality coupled with field measurements can help to improve the accuracy of hydrodynamic and sediment transport models. Understanding the drivers of salt marsh evolution is vital for informing restoration practices and designs, in order to improve coastal resilience, and develop and coastal management strategies.", "extra_context": {"keywords": ["salt marsh restoration", "vegetation monitoring", "NDVI", "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)", "aerial photogrammetry", "coastal morphodynamics", "ecogeomorphology"], "authors": ["William Nardin", "Yuri Taddia", "Michela Quitadamo", "Iacopo Vona", "Corinne Corbau", "Giulia Franchi", "Lorie W.

Human\u2013environment interactions operate over multiple spatial and temporal scales, requiring large data volumes of multi-resolution information for analysis. Climate change, land-use change, urbanization, and wildfires, for example, can affect regions differently depending on ecological and socioeconomic structures. The relative scarcity of data on both humans and natural systems at the relevant extent can be prohibitive when pursuing inquiries into these complex relationships. We explore the value of multitemporal, high-density, and high-resolution LiDAR, imaging spectroscopy, and digital camera data from the National Ecological Observatory Network\u2019s Airborne Observation Platform (NEON AOP) for Socio-Environmental Systems (SES) research. In addition to providing an overview of NEON AOP datasets and outlining specific applications for addressing SES questions, we highlight current challenges and provide recommendations for the SES research community to improve and expand its use of this platform for SES research. The coordinated, nationwide AOP remote sensing data, collected annually over the next 30 yr, offer exciting opportunities for cross-site analyses and comparison, upscaling metrics derived from LiDAR and hyperspectral datasets across larger spatial extents, and addressing questions across diverse scales. Integrating AOP data with other SES datasets will allow researchers to investigate complex systems and provide urgently needed policy recommendations for socio-environmental challenges. We urge the SES research community to further explore questions and theories in social and economic disciplines that might leverage NEON AOP data.", "extra_context": {"keywords": ["human-environment interactions", "socio-environmental systems", "NEON AOP", "remote sensing", "LiDAR", "imaging spectroscopy"], "authors": ["Elsa M.
