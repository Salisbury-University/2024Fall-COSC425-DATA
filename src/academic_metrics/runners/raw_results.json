A randomized crossover design study was conducted on 32 healthy adults (20.8 \u00b1 2.3 years; 11 females). Outcome measures were as follows: (1) arterial stiffness, (2) peak perceptual responses and likelihood to perform again, and (3) performance. Results: Post-exercise changes in central and brachial diastolic blood pressure were decreased in all groups. Post-exercise supine systolic blood pressure in no-BFR increased (mean difference (MD) = -4 \u00b1 1 mmHg, 95% CI (1\u20137), p = 0.003, \u03b72 = 0.13).
