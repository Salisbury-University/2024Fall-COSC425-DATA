[{"abstract": "The use of blood flow restriction (BFR) exercise in athletic and clinical settings has increased in the last five years. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of autoregulated (AR) and non-autoregulated (NAR) BFR biceps curl exercise on arterial stiffness. AR BFR cuffs adjust pressure as the muscle undergoes concentric and eccentric contractions, maintaining a constant pressure in the limb throughout the entire range of motion. NAR BFR training cuffs do not adjust pressure throughout the range of motion thus causing greater pressures in the limb during concentric contraction when the muscle size is enlarged. How this exercise acutely impacts arterial stiffness in upper body exercise is not well understood.", "extra_context": {"authors": ["Ruffhead, Campbell", "Rolnick, Nicholas", "Taylor, Susannah", "Marquette, Lisa", "Fedorko, Brent", "Walters, Jessica", "Werner, Tim"], "email": "cruffhead1@gulls.salisbury.edu", "publication": "Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise", "volume": "56", "issue": "10S", "page": "44", "publication_date": "October 2024", "doi": "10.1249/01.mss.0001052868.70990.0c", "keywords": ["BFR exercise", "arterial stiffness", "autoregulated", "non-autoregulated", "biceps curl"]}}, {"abstract": "PURPOSE: To characterize the effects of upper and lower body autoregulated blood flow restriction (AR-BFR), non-autoregulated BFR (NAR-BFR), and no BFR on rating perceived exertion (RPE), rating perceived discomfort (RPD), and gauge of a 1-10 Likert scale on the likelihood of performing the exercise training again. AR-BFR pressure cuffs adjust pressure automatically, maintaining a similar pressure during concentric and eccentric phases. However, NAR-BFR pressure cuffs do not accommodate for larger muscle diameters during the concentric phase, creating higher limb pressures compared to the eccentric phase.", "extra_context": {"authors": ["Zupnik, Sean", "Moghaddam, Masoud", "Rolnick, Nicholas", "Marquette, Lisa", "Taylor, Susannah", "Walters, Jessica", "Fedorko, Brent", "Werner, Tim"], "publication date": "October 2024", "journal": "Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise", "volume": "56", "issue": "10S", "pages": "964-965", "DOI": "10.1249/01.mss.0001060920.34828.c8", "keywords": ["Blood Flow Restriction", "Exercise", "Subjective Assessments", "Autoregulated", "Non-autoregulated"]}}, {"abstract": "Predation can lead to nonlethal injury as well as mortality in turtles, with many Clemmys guttata (Spotted Turtle) having predator-induced limb and foot amputations. The impact of such injuries on movements of freshwater turtles remains poorly understood. We tracked Spotted Turtles (n = 20) in a single population on the Delmarva Peninsula using radio telemetry for \u223c1 year. Seven turtles had at least 1 limb or foot completely amputated by a predator, and the remaining 13 were uninjured. When comparing movements among turtles, we found no difference in home-range sizes between male (n = 8) and female (n = 7) nor between injured (n = 7) and uninjured (n = 8) Spotted Turtles during their breeding season. However, injured turtles (n = 5) had smaller home ranges (mean \u00b1 SE = 0.26 \u00b1 0.14 ha) than uninjured turtles (n = 12, 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 ha) during the nonbreeding season, when turtles are more terrestrial. Our findings suggest a potential ecological cost of nonlethal injury, as predator effects might extend beyond simple mortality.", "extra_context": {"authors": ["Karsin M. Bachran", "Tami. S.
