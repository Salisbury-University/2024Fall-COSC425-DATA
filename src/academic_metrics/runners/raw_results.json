AR BFR cuffs adjust pressure as the muscle undergoes concentric and eccentric contractions, maintaining a constant pressure in the limb throughout the entire range of motion. NAR BFR training cuffs do not adjust pressure throughout the range of motion thus causing greater pressures in the limb during concentric contraction when the muscle size is enlarged. How this exercise acutely impacts arterial stiffness in upper body exercise is not well understood.\n\n### METHODS\nFollowing a randomized familiarization period with AR or NAR BFR biceps curl exercise, 33 adults (20 \u00b1 2 years; 11 females) participated in 3 randomized sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no-BFR (no cuffs) separated by 1-week washout periods. Using 20% of the 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) with 2-second concentric/eccentric cadence, participants performed 4 sets of biceps curls to failure. Training limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both BFR sessions. Measurements before and immediately following the training session included blood pressure acquisition, arterial tonometry, and ultrasonography of the carotid artery. Between and within effects of treatment on central systolic blood pressure (cSBP), central diastolic BP (cDBP), central pulse pressure (cPP), central mean arterial pressure (cMAP), pulse wave velocity (PWV), beta-stiffness index (\u03b2-stiff), and arterial compliance (AC) were analyzed with two-way ANOVAs.\n\n### RESULTS\nThere were no baseline differences in variable of interest (all p > 0.05). cDBP increased posted exercise in all three groups (AR-BFR mean difference (MD) = 7 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01; NAR-BFR MD = 6 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01; no BFR MD = 5 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01). And there was a non-significant trend in \u03b2-stiff (MD = 1.25 \u00b1 0.46 au, p = 0.07) and AC (MD = -0.3 \u00b1 0.1 mm2/mmHg x 10-1, p = 0.07) with the no BFR treatment.\n\n### CONCLUSION\nThe present findings show acute AR-BFR and NAR-BFR bicep training did not impact arterial stiffness.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by the American College of Sports Medicine\nView full article text", "extra_context": {"keywords": [], "authors": ["Campbell Ruffhead", "Nicholas Rolnick", "Susannah Taylor", "Lisa Marquette", "Brent Fedorko", "Jessica Walters", "Tim Werner"], "date": "October 2024", "journal": "Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise", "DOI": "10.1249/01.mss.0001052868.70990.0c"}}, {"abstract": "G-17 Thematic Poster \u2013 Investigations of Exercise Blood Flow Restriction Effects Of Upper And Lower Body Blood Flow Restriction Training On Subjective Assessments\n\nAuthors: Sean Zupnik, Masoud Moghaddam, Nicholas Rolnick, Lisa Marquette, Susannah Taylor, Jessica Walters, Brent Fedorko, Tim Werner FACSM\n\nAuthor Information:\n1.

AR-BFR pressure cuffs adjust pressure automatically, maintaining a similar pressure during concentric and eccentric phases. However, NAR-BFR pressure cuffs do not accommodate for larger muscle diameters during the concentric phase, creating higher limb pressures compared to the eccentric phase.\n\n**METHODS:** 33 adults (21 \u00b1 2 years; 11 females) participated in upper body sessions and 20 adults (23 \u00b1 5 years; 7 females) in lower body sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no BFR in a randomized fashion separated by 1-week including a familiarization session. All participants in the upper body sessions performed four sets of dumbbell curls and those in the lower body sessions performed four sets of wall squats with handheld dumbbells to volitional fatigue using 20% of their 1-RM with 2-second cadence and 1 minute rest periods. Cuffs were placed at the proximal portion of the arms and thighs, and limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both BFR treatments during exercise and rest periods for both sessions. Subjective measurements of RPE, RPD, and the 1-10 Likert scale were taken immediately post-exercise while the cuffs were inflated. Two-way ANOVAs were conducted on variables of interest.\n\n**RESULTS:** There were no significant differences in RPE between AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no BFR in the upper and lower body sessions (p = 0.13). A significant difference in RPD was found between upper body AR-BFR and no BFR (mean difference (MD) = 2.23 \u00b1 0.47, p < 0.01) and upper body NAR-BFR and no BFR (mean difference (MD) = 1.32 \u00b1 0.47, p = 0.05).\n\n**CONCLUSION:** The use of BFR does not appear to influence subjective ratings of exertion in the upper and lower limbs. Additionally, AR-BFR and NAR-BFR devices may cause more subjective discomfort compared to no BFR.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by the American College of Sports Medicine.", "extra_context": {"keywords": ["Exercise", "Blood Flow Restriction", "Autoregulated BFR", "Non-Autoregulated BFR", "Perceived Exertion", "Perceived Discomfort"], "authors": ["Sean Zupnik", "Masoud Moghaddam", "Nicholas Rolnick", "Lisa Marquette", "Susannah Taylor", "Jessica Walters", "Brent Fedorko", "Tim Werner"], "date": "2024-10-01", "journal": "Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise", "volume": "56(10S)", "page": "964-965", "doi": "10.1249/01.mss.0001060920.34828.c8"}}, {"abstract": "Predation can lead to nonlethal injury as well as mortality in turtles, with many Clemmys guttata (Spotted Turtle) having predator-induced limb and foot amputations.

Undergraduate women (n = 658) completed the Rape Victim Empathy-During Subscale and Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization. Rape experience was associated with greater empathy, especially for those with any forcible experience. Perhaps due to weaker memory of their own rape event, incapacitated victims may be relatively less able than forcible victims to understand another victim's perspective during a rape.

Outcome measures were as follows: (1) arterial stiffness, (2) peak perceptual responses and likelihood to perform again, and (3) performance. Results: Post-exercise changes in central and brachial diastolic blood pressure were decreased in all groups. Post-exercise supine systolic blood pressure in no-BFR increased (mean difference (MD) = -4 \u00b1 1 mmHg, 95% CI (1\u20137), p = 0.003, \u03b72 = 0.13).

Countries, communities and organizations are realizing that passing profits to workers increases wealth at all levels of society. The benefits, widely known, include personal prosperity, organizational profitability and stability, and a host of economic benefits for communities in which EO companies operate. Selling a company to employees, or starting a cooperative organization containing worker owners, is not without risk. New skills are required for the company to reap the rewards inherent in EO organizations, but the method of creating this change varies significantly from one organization to another. Each is unique, but there are some factors that are common to most EO organizations that have achieved a dynamic organizational culture. These factors, which are critical for success, can be isolated using structured research, organized through a lens of general systems theory and operationalized using principles of Learning Management (LM). The result is an organized knowledge transfer plan that maximizes resources and provides the highest probability of a successful transition to a uniquely profitable EO company. KEYWORDS: Employee ownership, knowledge transfer, learning management, critical success factors, engagement culture. JEL CLASSIFICATION: O43\n\n1. Overview Research indicates that extraordinarily successful employee-owned (EO) organizations have a culture that supports everyday employee engagement (Berry and Fitz-Gerald Citation2018), making a unique contribution to the prosperity of the organization. Why this occurs is the subject of ongoing research designed to discover what factors contribute to employee-ownership principles, and result in increases in revenues and profitability. Literature containing information on high-performing work systems (HPWS) seems to lay a foundation for EO practices (Calo and Shipper, Citation2018), but the commitment, and ownership mentality occurs in highly successful organizations that are owned by employees in trusts, cooperative agreements, or through equity arrangements. The results of EO are well documented and include organizations outperforming competitors in a variety of areas (Kruse Citation2022), attracting and maintaining top talent (Kurland Citation2018) increases in innovation and efficiency (Agafitei and Avasilcai Citation2015), and resilience during economic downturns. For employee-owners, the benefits are also substantial and include job satisfaction and security (Uzuriaga, 2028), increased motivation (Blasi et al. Citation2008) and of course the financial rewards that come from owning equity in the organization, among others. One of the largest benefits of EO, however, may be the economic benefits seen by communities when workers become owners (Inserra, Conway, and Rodat Citation2002). Jobs are preserved and increased in local communities (J. R. Blasi, Freeman, and Kruse Citation2013), and stability is improved with the longer-term outlook of EO organizations. EO companies also tend to have a reciprocal commitment to the communities in which they reside, contributing to an upward spiral of growth and economic prosperity. Some scholars note that EO organizations have higher levels of commitment to the environment, locally and beyond, and often engage in practices that are ecologically and socially sustainable. None of these benefits are realized merely because of transferring ownership to employees. They become a reality when employees begin to think like owners \u2013 at all levels of the organization. The first portion of this paper is dedicated to the factors that create this unique culture within EO organizations, and the latter is devoted to operationalizing \u2013 actually transforming \u2013 workers into owners. This paper delivers a set of critical success factors (CSFs) of employee ownership as discovered in approximately 100 carefully curated articles, cases, and books dedicated to the subject of employee engagement in EO organizations. CSF research is appropriate because it is designed to produce a set of factors that must receive top priority during a high-stakes implementation (Ram and Corkindale Citation2014), and if they are neglected, the likelihood of success decreases significantly. CSF is used to manage enterprise-wide change initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions, complex software implementations and other major projects (Trkman Citation2010). Becoming employee-owned requires a level of business acumen that needs to be supported by research, which must be translated into activities that will contribute directly to the success of the firm. Using the methods outlined in the next section, a metasynthesis was undertaken that yielded CSFs and their context, as reported by dozens of successful organizations. The broad CSFs discovered in the literature are as follows: Accountability/Responsibility, Communication, Governance, Innovation, Leadership, Working in Teams, Training, Transparency (Especially in Finance). There were other CSFs identified in the literature that were shown to be a result of attending to other CSFs over time. This paper was developed to explain the process of implementing employee ownership, and the below are outcomes. Culture \u2013 Values Engagement HR Practices Recruiting Selection On Boarding Training and Development Rewards and Recognition Retention\n2. Research methods There are several principles and practices underpinning the research application to CSFs. The first is the method for determining the CSFs themselves. This involves a metasynthesis of a large body of literature using a qualitative software system, NVivo. The process of discovering CSFs is employed to ensure the accuracy and validity of the study. The paper is also grounded in the general systems theory, which provides a foundation for modelling the before and after state of an organization as it moves into an EO culture. Finally, principles of Learning Management (LM) are used to operationalize the transformation. Each of these practices is explained in the next section.\n2.1. Critical success factor research CSF research is used to create benchmarks that track the performance of implementations in high-risk situations. These are typically used before, during, and after implementations (Zheng, Yang, and McLean Citation2010). The results of this paper can be used to evaluate the processes necessary to reduce the risk of converting to employee ownership and should be used by advisors and top managers who typically make decisions and allocate resources during the planning and execution of complex ventures. CSFs, used in a variety of industries and for a purposes, dates to the 1960s and has undergone continuous revisions. Jack Rockart of Massachusetts Institute of Technology popularized CSF methodology in the late 1970s for practicing managers (Aziz, Salleh, and Mustafa Citation2012; Bullen and Rockart Citation1981). More recently, business researchers have adopted this methodology in a variety of settings including operations (Netland Citation2016), change management (Kash et al. Citation2014; Trkman Citation2010), project management (Chih and Zwikael Citation2015; Ika, Diallo, and Thuillier Citation2012), enterprise systems implementations (Ram and Corkindale Citation2014), logistics (Denolf et al. Citation2015; Luthra, Garg, and Haleem Citation2015) and others. Scientifically predicting CSFs for a given initiative starts with an analysis of literature concerning past projects. The objective of the analysis is to learn what worked in the past during similar initiatives (Hanafizadeh et al. Citation2012). CSF research typically includes several phases, the first of which is desk research which was undertaken for this project. CSFs for high-risk initiatives requires conducting a metasynthesis of prior research, then verifying analysis results with a qualitative phase (phenomenological interviews), and an empirical research project in the form of broad-based surveys among those who have lived the experience of becoming employee owned. In the metasynthesis phase of the study, relevant materials are identified, reviewed and coded using qualitative research software, in this case, NVivo. The literature analysis yielded a set of reliable CSFs because a substantial portion of the documents used are case studies that provide in-depth research into the factors that create the desired EO culture. In the second and third phases of CSF research, the factors may be ranked in order of importance and dependencies, organized in terms of stakeholders who will bear responsibility, and evaluated for feasibility (Akhavan and Zahedi Citation2014). A strong research model is necessary to ensure the value of CSFs (Dabestani, Taghavi, and Saljoughian Citation2014) and researchers must evaluate not only the variety and nature of CSFs, but the methods and variables inherent in similar past projects (Chien Citation2014). Using standard research methods to explore CSFs allows researchers to consider extraordinarily complex interactions that managers might overlook and that could contribute to organizational performance (Hesselmann and Kunal Citation2014). Although research methods for determining CSFs are standard, industries vary as do types and complexities of initiatives (Arif and Shalhoub Citation2014), so CSFs differ from one study to another (Keramati et al. Citation2012). In the case of this project, however, EO organizations exhibited similar attributes, and some sources provided specific details concerning how the transformation from employees to owners was achieved over time. Understanding the methods for determining CSFs might be as useful as the CSFs themselves, because undertaking research to determine probable CSFs creates an awareness of a broad range of factors that should receive consideration in complex business undertakings (Ab Talib and Abdul Hamid, Citation2014). Most articles containing empirical studies on CSFs yielded both a general methodology for establishing CSFs and specific CSFs that may be applicable to high-risk projects of diverse types.\n2.2. General systems theory The principles of Learning Management (LM) are grounded in general systems theory. Where humans are involved, there will be knowledge transfer to affect change. The system can be a person, community, or larger economy. In this paper, we are concerned with EO organizations and what parts of the system make them high performing. Using CSFs, the metasynthesis was used to create a model for a general system that demonstrates high employee engagement. To apply this information, a basic understanding of general systems theory, the process of modelling and how these are used in scientific research, provides the foundation for using LM to systematically shift a system, in this case an EO organization, into a new state. Von Bertalanffy (Citation1950) explained that general systems theory creates a method for reliably researching complex systems. The first is that an entire system is dependent on several subsystems, each of which are dependent on itself and other subsystems. In an organization, these may be teams or departments. The system also interacts with the environment and changes over time. The effects of ownership on communities and larger economies are an example of how an organization, as a system, affects is surroundings. General systems theory is applicable to almost any system, but to study a complex EO organization, the subsystems must be identified and modelled, to create a framework. The CSFs, explained in detail later, are used as a benchmark to design interventions, identify methods of improvement and form a foundation for theoretical assumptions that can be used in similar situations. Case studies in the literature collection provided evidence of a system that shifted to create a new, high-performing organization. The literature was lacking in a clear method of knowledge transfer that provided reliable results, although there were plenty of disparate examples of dynamic transformation. General systems theory allows the researcher to create a clear path for growth and change, while allowing for the unique attributes of EO organizations in many industries, and of all sizes. To operationalize the transformation of a system that involves knowledge transfer, LM principles help simplify the process.\n2.3. Principles of learning management (LM) The first step in developing a learning program to increase ownership culture, is to conduct a gap analysis. Using the concepts of systems theory, develop a before and after model of the EO organization. With roots in change management, and applicable to a variety of initiatives, this classic analysis can be conducted by the top management team (TMT), the human resources (HR) team, or outside advisors, with input from supervisors and workers at various levels of the organization. Evaluate the current state of employees. What do they know now and what type of knowledge programs are currently being offered? The transformation to ownership practices will require new knowledge, and the gap is filled with learning programs. Between the employee and owner mindset are knowledge requirements, which will vary by organization. The only constant is that every person in the organization will need additional information concerning ownership, and the new responsibilities of employee owners. Fortunately, there is a finite number of ways knowledge is transferred in most organizations. Considering the change required, however, may yield an array of variables that must be considered before investing time and money in developing employees. Each company has resources which are limited in some way. Each industry has certain types of learners that must be considered. For example, from the TMT to the least-paid employee in a professional services firm, there may be few differences in learners. Workers have the same level of education and similar backgrounds. In a manufacturing firm, however, there may be many layers of employee \u2018types\u2019 from well-educated, to highly skilled, to less skilled and those for whom literacy is a challenge. When strategizing how to maximize the CSFs among workers, consider each of the available methods of knowledge transfer. And although training is considered essential for optimal EO performance, it is rarely ready at the onset of the conversion to employee ownership, so careful planning is necessary. Picking knowledge transfer strategies that will have broad impact for a wide audience, at the best possible price, is the goal of LM. The list below is shown from least expensive to most expensive, and least controlled to most controlled. When we review the CSFs in detail, each of the LM strategies below should be evaluated as a means to facilitate the transformation process. Informal Discussions, Formal and Informal Mentoring, Communications, Signage (Hard Copy and Online), Published Policies and Processes, Experience and On the Job Training, Training.\n2.3.1. Informal discussions Informal discussions happen in regular work activities throughout the organization. Tacit means spoken, or observed knowledge, while explicit (codified) is written. Some people refer to knowledge as informal and formal. The important thing to remember is that informal conversations happen all the time, and they are the most important aspect of employees gaining information. The more informed the leaders of each team, department, or committee concerning the benefits of EO, the better. Discussions start the moment an announcement is made that the company will become employee owned.\n2.3.2. Mentoring Mentoring occurs continuously, but it is usually more formal in that a junior employee is paired with a more experienced co-worker. In some industries, mentoring is common and highly formalized with expected and documented outcomes. But in many cases, a senior worker will assume the responsibility whether a mentoring program exists or not. When starting out on the EO journey, leaders at all levels should be identified and receive communication concerning the benefits of EO.\n2.3.3. Communication Communication in this context refers to formal communication \u2013 sometimes spoken and at other times written. When embarking on EO, it is wise to create a communication plan that includes information from the TMT (or informed advisors of the company), in the form of meetings, emails, videos or other appropriate methods for getting the word out. Most mature ESOPS have annual, quarterly, and/or monthly meetings designed to inform the owners on the financial state of the company. It is common to have the CEO or other important figure communicate ownership information through emails or briefs monthly, or in some cases weekly. How you communicate with employee-owners will depend on how they learn in general. If an employee works on a computer, email may be appropriate. A front-line employee with limited access to company computers may rely on verbal communication from team leaders and supervisors.\n2.3.4. Hard and digital signage Signage helps control processes at all levels of society. Signs are inexpensive but can have a tremendous impact on virtually unlimited numbers of people. For example, a sign that shows the proper direction to a location can help thousands of people arrive at a destination. Signs that remind people of the values and mission of an organization keep everyone focused on what matters most. Signs can communicate information that contributes to a source of pride in an organization. Excellent safety records, exemplary customer service and employee recognition are but a few common forms of signage found in organizations. Tailor signage to remind people that they are now owners. Direct them to further resources. Place a QR code on a sign that takes people to relevant information concerning their new role as owners. This is a valuable and inexpensive method of transferring knowledge.\n2.3.5. Published policies and procedures Policies and procedures will be updated beginning almost immediately. As time moves forward, and employees become more capable of making decisions (for example) that improve company performance, these policies will evolve. For instance, in an employee setting, decisions may be made at the supervisor level. It is common for employee owners to make decisions for customer facing issues. Ideas also tend to come from all levels. Innovation and risk taking are more common when employees assume ownership responsibilities. These transitions can be formalized by creating and publishing policies.\n2.3.6. Experience and on the job training On-the-job training is the most common type of training in most organizations. It is inexpensive and readily available. To be effective, however, each supervisor, mentor, or team leader must be \u2018trained\u2019 to be a trainer. As employee ownership becomes a priority within the organization, these trainers, found at all levels of an organization, must be made aware of new expectations and conduct concerning taking ownership of day-to-day activities. This \u2018train-the-trainer\u2019 training occurs formally.\n2.3.7. Formal training and development Training is the most expensive form of employee development and should be undertaken when outcomes need to be measured. Training is designed to hold people accountable to performance. So, if a concept is merely \u2018good to know\u2019 use one of the above methods to convey knowledge. Onboarding is formal training for new employees, and this will evolve as ownership becomes commonplace in the organization. Because owners can grow into a variety of roles at many levels of an organization, some companies engage in \u2018Everboarding\u2019 by providing required training on a quarterly basis, or as the company evolves. Examples of training might include basic finance or cost accounting, something that regular workers would never need to know, but might help employee owners contribute meaningfully to the organization, and in turn, their own wealth.\n3. Results of the CSF metasynthesis Recall that NVivo was used to cull through large volumes of literature yielding not only the CSFs themselves, but also the context in which they occur. The cases and references used in the metasynthesis, are listed in the reference section with an asterisk (*). These CSFs are mentioned briefly in the Overview section of the paper, and a more thorough explanation of each CSF, in context, is presented below. NVivo delivers CSFs in context by showing the words immediately before and after the term. Any reference can immediately be accessed for further information. To illustrate how the software delivers information in context, see the samples below.\n3.1. Accountability Accountability or responsibility were referenced 200 times in over 50 different sources. The sources showed a number of items for which employees were held accountable, and types of responsibility. Attributes of responsibility were also revealed. Financial Responsibility (Profits), Assuming Responsibility for Various Functions, A Sense of Collective Responsibility, Developing a System of Responsibilities, Responsible to Others, Ongoing Commitment and Responsibility, Increased Levels of Responsibility, How to Acknowledge Responsibility.\n3.2. Communication Communication was expanded in the NVivo qualitative search criteria to include synonyms, which yielded over 100 mentions in 74 sources. The research revealed the importance of communication through the following broad themes: TMT (Top Management Team) Communication, Information Sharing, Team and Committee Communication, Setting and Promoting Levels of Expected Communication, Lack of Communication is a Problem, Establishing Channels of Communication, Creating Formal Expectations Concerning Communication, Increased Need for Interpersonal Communication.\n3.3. Governance The results of the term governance yielded some unexpected results, which indicated that not only was governance important at the top levels of the organization, but also throughout the entire workforce. This probe resulted in over 4,200 references in 80 files. Some of the important aspects of governance are: Transitioning Governance to Incorporate EO, Levels of Changing Control and Governance, Guidelines for Making Decisions, Social Governance Becomes Important, Importance of Board/Leadership Governance Skills, Employee Role in Governance, Business Structure and Governance, Democratic Aspects of Governance.\n3.4. Innovation Innovation was found in nearly every reference and cited almost 3,000 times. It is clear that innovation is important and the factors upon which it is dependent sheds light on how the mindset of innovation is fostered throughout the company. The literature provided some significant information on innovation, how it is fostered and its results: Establishing a Culture of Innovation (and Sustainability), Provide Models of Personal Innovation, Eliminating Obstacles to Innovation, Creating Initiatives that Support Innovation, HR Incentives for Creativity and Innovation, Discussions Surrounding Climate for Innovation, Demonstrate the Power of Innovation.\n3.5. Leadership Leadership was also mentioned over 1,000 times and in nearly all sources. The importance of leadership was not limited to the TMT, but was emanated from the top in all cases, then inherent at all levels of most organizations. Actionable ideas and models concerning leadership were discovered throughout the literature. Some of the themes are as follows: Addressing Challenges in Employee Leadership, Designing Jobs and Roles to Incorporate Leadership, Peer Commitment through Leadership, Formal Mentor Plan for Leadership Traits, Policies and Practices for Leadership, Benchmarking Leadership, TMT Leadership, Identifying Leaders.\n3.6. Teamwork Teamwork was an important theme throughout the literature, but the exact word search yielded few results. It was only when the phrase was expanded to include committees, groups and other forms of cooperative engagement did the importance of teamwork become clear. This list was comprised from a review of the exact term \u2018teamwork\u2019 and other similar phrases. Incentives and Pay for Teamwork, Communicating Value of Teamwork, Provide Skill Building for Teamwork, Teamwork and Spirit, Employee Involvement and Training, Structuring of Teams, Participatory Decision-making for Teams, Information Sharing in Teams.\n3.7. Training Training, as an exact reference, was found in nearly every source and was mentioned 4300 times. It is clear that successful EO organizations engage heavily in training and development of employees. Specific accounts of the term training were linked to a rather large number of initiatives, and it was described in numerous ways. Equity Compensation Training, Financial Training, Cross Training, KSA Development through Extensive Training, Formal Training Leading to Responsibility, Education, Certification and Training, Basic Math and English Training, Importance of Onboarding.\n3.8. Transparency Transparency (especially in finance) was cited as extremely important and referenced in a variety of formats, such as open-book management, honesty and integrity. It was cited as important from the TMT down through the entire organization. Transparency was fostered through a variety of methods and its beneficial results were identified throughout the literature. Clear Expectations Concerning Transparency, High Morale through Transparency, Financial Transparency, Transparency and Empowerment, TMT Advocating Transparency, Integrity through Transparency, Citizenship, Community and Transparency, Trust through Transparency.\n4. Discussion Learning can be managed like any other activity. Consider the organization\u2019s existing assets and processes. Is there a strong HR or marketing team that can help develop communications or training programs? Are there teams or committees that might be tasked with disseminating information? While there is no substitute for leadership among the TMT, effective knowledge transfer at all levels will help develop leaders throughout the organization. The extent to which this can be accomplished, will provide the highest dividends of employee ownership. With the methods of knowledge transfer in mind, consider the CSFs in terms of knowledge delivery. Then, take into consideration, the workers\u2019 current level of knowledge on each, along with the method that best transfers added information. In order to simplify the process, use LM principles to group like learners. Learners can be grouped in terms of supervisory level, skill sets, department, team, committee, or country. Of course, there will always be an \u2018all learner\u2019 plan that includes, at minimum, onboarding and orientation, which is a significant factor in creating and maintaining ownership culture. Once learners are grouped, a plan is formed for each set of learners. Recall that knowledge can be transferred in a variety of ways. Ownership culture must be broad-based within the organization to be effective, so at minimum, there will be a mix of learning interventions designed for all learners. This is similar to the functioning of a learning management system (LMS) that is commonly found in universities, associations and larger organizations (Whitcomb Citation2016).\n4.1. Unique knowledge requirements Given the variables of what knowledge might need to be transferred based on current resources and practices, it is prudent to organize learners so progress can be tracked in clear and measurable terms. Broad examples of CSFs are assigned to learning groups along with a method of transferring knowledge for each. Since every industry is different this will vary significantly from one organization to the next, as the literature suggests. The following categories can be used to represent groupings of like learners. When considering what must be learned, and how this knowledge transfer will occur, it will be essential to keep in mind the best method for uniform delivery to these groups of learners. These groups will be assigned \u2018learning plans\u2019 for the purposes of exposing employees to ownership according to the CSFs discovered and outlined above.\n4.1.1. All employees Depending on the size of the company, most employees already receive orientation, compliance training, timekeeping material, benefits education and other onboarding information.\n4.1.2. Top management team (TMT) In addition to assuming responsibility for overall communication and strategy concerning the transformation program, the TMT must become intimately familiar with the messages, training and forms of communication expected of each member.\n4.1.3. Client teams Professional services firms often have procedures surrounding client interactions. EO organizations typically have improved client service.\n4.1.4. Subject matter experts These groups of like learners need uniform knowledge throughout the organization regardless of their geographic location \u2013 like safety officers on project sites, logisticians, IT technicians, project managers etc.\n4.1.5. Divisions Divisions may share similar overall policies but have very different learning requirements. These divisions might share the same values, but have very different operating procedures.\n4.1.6. Job categories and description It is very common for organizations to require certain skill sets for certain jobs and levels. These competencies can be taken right from a good job description, and these in turn are updated to reflect the new responsibilities workers take when gaining ownership.\n4.1.7. Number of employee reports First time supervisors might need training in communication protocol in addition to perhaps financial literacy. Directors and VPs need different types of training. However, everyone engaged in interviewing, hiring and firing at all levels might require the same training. It is not uncommon for organizations to begin to offer leadership and other developmental training to those supervising others. When you begin to evaluate groups of learners in terms of what must be learned and how it will occur, your opportunities increase significantly. Evaluating all these combinations for feasibility, reliability and growth, provides a foundation for a sound workplace development strategy. One general strategy found in the literature was the use of committees for various purposes. These groups, both formal and informal, were used to plan and dissipate knowledge at all levels, and for a variety of groups. Ideas were tested in committees and then deployed. For the purpose of this research, we will take the \u2018all employee\u2019 category, and begin to apply the CSFs and the methods of knowledge transfer (Argote et al. Citation2000). For instance, signage concerning the new status of all employees as owners, can be displayed both in hard copy, as signs in the workplace, and digitally on the company intranet. Communication will start from the TMT and move through the organization in the form of articles, emails, meetings and informal conversations. A formal communication plan is not uncommon during the planning phase of transition to employee ownership. All employees will be exposed to ownership through new orientation training, which will become used for onboarding new employees in the future. Financial literacy communication, and perhaps training, will be offered to supervisors and client teams that have fiscal responsibility.\n5. Conclusion and opportunities for additional research Critical Success Factors (CSFs) are useful for gaining insight into what needs to be accomplished to gain maximum benefit of EO. The information gained in the literature was from mature organizations that instilled the culture over years of fine tuning. Companies hired consultants on occasion, but others had dynamic leaders who created the vision for the future. CSFs are used to mitigate risk, and selling to employees can be risky if profitability takes a downturn. Employees can see ownership as a risk rather than an opportunity, and knowledge helps reduce these risks. Many employees do not have the understanding to contribute towards the bottom line, until they receive training. In mature EO companies, human resources (HR) practices are honed to include sourcing, and training, people who are a good fit for EO. The purpose of this research, however, is to provide a path for companies to gain the benefits of EO, so risks will be reduced.\n5.1. Second and third phases of CSF research To further cull the CSFs into action items, the second and third phases of CSF research should be undertaken. In the second phase, members of management who have first-hand experience in the cultural and operational aspects of developing EO culture should be interviewed. This is known as a qualitative phenomenological study, as these people have \u2018experienced the phenomenon\u2019 of transforming an organization into ownership. The steps they took, and the importance of each CSF in the process, are documented and coded for similarities. During this phase, the CSFs are also ranked in order of importance and assigned to groups, or teams who are responsible for managing the process. Finally, dependencies are determined. For instance, an excellent onboarding program may not be possible without a strong HR department.

In this quantitative cross-sectional survey study, a volunteer sample of 307 undergraduate students (75.2% White, 68.7% Female) enrolled in health and fitness courses at a Mid-Atlantic region United States University and Community College completed an online demographic questionnaire, International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), and Behavioral Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-3). A series of independent samples t-tests were conducted to compare relative autonomy index (RAI) and subscale scores (obtained via the BREQ-3), as well as physical activity scores (MET-minutes/week obtained via the IPAQ-SF). Statistically significant differences in exercise motivation and physical activity were found based on student age, housing status, major/program of study, and gender identity.

The prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders in patients with symptoms of arrhythmia, palpitations, is well documented but how this compares to patients at the greatest risk for major cardiac arrythmia is unknown. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of anxiety or depression in patients with symptomatic palpitations vs patients at risk for major cardiac arrhythmia (congestive heart failure) and further evaluate the effects on their quality of life using the SF-36 assessment tool. Methods: Patients with palpitations (50 subjects) or prior ICD (50 subjects) were given the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Results: There was an insignificant trend for increased anxiety, with a mean GAD-7 score in palpitations group of 4.14 vs 3.04 in CHF group with anxiety prevalence in 40% palpitations and 28% of ICD patients. The mean score of PHQ-9 in palpitations group is 4.84 vs 4.96 in CHF group with 38% of the palpitation group having depression compared to 44% of the ICD group. The SF-36 physical function domain showed that the palpitations group was more functional than the ICD group with a mean score of 0.709 in palpitations group vs 0.513 in CHF group (P <0.05.) Subjective frequency of palpitations had a mean of 3.47 in the palpitation group vs 1.5 in the CHF group with P<0.05. Conclusions: Patients presenting with symptomatic palpitations have more symptoms of anxiety than patients at risk for major arrythmia, but have less functional limitations than the ICD group, as expected. There is a non-significant trend to more anxiety in the palpitations group, but both groups are far above populations norms of 2-4%. Depression is not different between the groups but both groups are far above the population averages of 5-6%. Patients with palpitations have fewer physical limitations but have at least an equal amount of anxiety and depression as a far more ill group of patients. It is a standard of care to treat symptomatic palpitations due to PVCs with beta blockers; this will not help symptoms of anxiety and it may worsen depression. When seeing patients presenting with palpitations, or patients with chronic heart disease and an ICD, we should consider an evaluation for anxiety and depression.", "extra_context": {"keywords": ["Anxiety", "Heart failure", "Arrhythmias", "Depression", "Arrhythmias, treatment of"], "authors": ["Mark Treuth, MD", "Kunnal Patel, BS, MS", "Justin Rissmiller, DO", "Veera Holdai, PhD"], "date": "2024-11-11", "journal": "Circulation", "volume": "150", "issue": "Suppl_1", "page": "A4148046"}}, {"abstract": "\"A Message from the 2023\u20132026 Co-Editors.\" New Political Science, 46(1), p. 1\n", "extra_context": {"authors": ["Sarah M.

Synoptic composites were constructed using the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) for all cases, as well as each cyclone group, using an LES repository spanning from 2006\u20132020. Additionally, 95 percent bootstrapped confidence intervals were created for each cyclone track to compare the initial mesoscale environmental properties (i.e., surface lake/air temperature and wind direction/speed) and LES impact (i.e., duration, maximum snowfall, and property damage). Synoptic composites of all LES cases exhibited an archetypal LES synoptic pattern consisting of an upper-level low geopotential height anomaly over the Hudson Bay and surface dipole structure centered across the Great Lakes basin. Regarding the different tracks, NEs and COs featured dynamic support in the form of enhanced turbulent mixing and synoptic vertical forcing, while ACs and GLs had greater thermodynamic support in the form of higher lapse rates and heightened heat and moisture fluxes. However, the bootstrapping analysis revealed minimal differences in LES impact between the cyclone types.\n\nKeywords: lake-effect; synoptic; mesoscale; winter weather; Great Lakes\n\n1. Introduction\n\nCovering more than 243,450 km2, the North American Great Lakes (hereafter referred to as the \u201cGreat Lakes\u201d) represent the second largest freshwater resource in the world and have a significant impact on the region\u2019s climatology [1,2] and local economy [3,4]. Among these impacts, and one of the more unique consequences of the Great Lakes, are the localized peaks in annual snowfall totals in downwind areas. These \u201csnowbelts\u201d receive up to 55% of their annual snowfall [5] from narrow snow bands that form mid-lake as a result of air mass destabilization and resultant convection (referred to as \u201clake-effect snow\u201d (LES)).\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. LES Repository\n\nLES cases were identified using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Severe Storms Database (NOAA). Early versions of this database, which began in 1950, only documented severe thunderstorm phenomena (e.g., tornadoes, severe wind, and hail). Since 1996, this archive has incorporated 48 types of severe weather events based on a National Weather Service (NWS) NOAA directive, which outlines specific criteria for each event type [45]. Storm events are grouped together by county and severe weather type.\n\n3. Results\n\nFrom 2006\u20132020, 79 total LES cases were extracted from the NOAA Severe Storms Database. Of these 79 cases, 8 (10.13%) cyclones were classified as NEs, 21 (26.58%) cyclones were classified as GLs, and 19 (24.04%) cyclones were classified as ACs and COs. Additionally, six (7.6%) of the cases were classified as \u201cother\u201d, and another six (7.6%) were \u201cindeterminate\u201d.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nA conventional synoptic setup and evolution for the Great Lakes region was noted when looking at the aggregate of all observed LES cases. This setup is characterized by an upper-level low geopotential height anomaly (i.e., trough) upstream of the Great Lakes basin that propagates east and intensifies throughout its progression.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThe objective of this research was to assess the overlying synoptic conditions conducive to LES over NW PA, an area often overlooked in the literature. An emphasis was placed on the evolution of synoptic fields and how possible discrepancies may have led to different impacts, including the duration of the event, maximum snowfall totals, and property damage.", "extra_context": {"authors": ["Jake Wiley", "Christopher Elcik"], "date": "2024-11-20", "keywords": ["lake-effect", "synoptic", "mesoscale", "winter weather", "Great Lakes"], "journal": "Meteorology", "volume": "3", "issue": "4", "pages": "391-411", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/meteorology3040019", "submission_received": "22 September 2024", "revised": "5 November 2024", "accepted": "13 November 2024", "published": "20 November 2024"}}, {"abstract": "\"The Isolated Presidency.\" Congress & the Presidency, 51(3), pp. 360\u2013361\nCash, Jordan T.

The soundtracks come from Soul by Pete Docter and Kemp Powers and Nomadland by Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, both released in 2020. The films are sonically worlds apart: Soul is dominated by jazz music by Jon Batiste and contemporary electronic music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, while Nomadland features modern classical music by Ludovico Einaudi and \u00d3lafur Arnalds. Ironically, despite sounding profoundly different, both films draw from true stories in order to teach audioviewers about living well, even in the midst of death. Or, to reapply Danijela\u2019s words about Waking Life (Richard Linklater, 2001), these films emphasise \u201cthe dualistic nature of human experience, the pleasure of being alive and the implicit proximity of death.\u201d Walker combines cinematherapy with sound studies to make a case for the wisdom of both films that have helped her cope with the grief of Danijela\u2019s death, in the hope that this might resonate for those readers who find similar comfort in their own film-to-person relationships.\n\nThe soundtrack of Soul is uncommonly important for giving shape and meaning to the film. The music features extremes that correlate with Joe\u2019s shifting self as he moves through several earthly and unearthly places. On earth, Joe is a tall, thin African American man with distinctive features, but in the Great Beyond (after life) and Great Before (pre-birth), he is a simple blue shape with a face and accessories (hat and glasses). The consistent voice of Jamie Foxx as Joe makes his changing visual state less worrisome than playfully sensical, while the music relays his emotional journey and how we should feel about every part of it. Because the main character is not given a fixed physical form, Soul urges me to think of identity and being beyond the body. Soul enabled Danijela and I to talk about death and the possibilities of her life beyond her physical presence without having to be any more dogmatic than the film is. By revisiting the film, I not only extend this conversation with Danijela: I expand my understanding of what a cinematic soundtrack can affirm for me.\n\nMany characters of Soul are surprisingly abstract, from the pre-born people of the Great Before (simple rounded shapes with limbs and no distinguishing features) to the spectral beings who guide human beings before and after their lives on earth (two-dimensional faces and bodies, like moving silhouettes of Picasso sketches). Unlike other Disney features that show painstaking attention to minute details of form\u2014the chipped trim mouldings in Andy\u2019s home for Toy Story (John Lasseter, 1995), the individual follicles of fur on Sully in Monsters, Inc. (Pete Docter, Davide Silverman and Lee Unkrich, 2001), or the textured insides of coconuts in Moana (Ron Clements, John Musker, and Don Hall, 2016)\u2014Soul gives me an experience of comparative visual unmooring. This places uncommon weight on the repetition of musical patterns and the consistency of certain voices\u2014most notably Joe\u2019s and 22\u2019s\u2014as anchoring presences. The film makes me listen more carefully than usual to every part of music and speech that drives everything forward and in relation to which I understand the images more fully. If the dominant voices stay mostly consistent, the near wall-to-wall music changes shape often, challenging me to accept a process of almost-perpetual adaptation. This musical changeability reflects the extremity of the Joe\u2019s and 22\u2019s transformative journeys through the film: from losing life (Joe) and resisting life (22), to re-entering life (Joe) and beginning life (22). The near-constant sonic flux within Soul makes me align myself with these characters as I must keep adapting to the changes I hear through the film. Like Joe and 22, I make a journey from death to life: from listening to Soul again as an act of remembrance, to reunderstanding how Danijela lives in the way I choose to hear it. The other dominant music of Soul is acoustic jazz music by Jon Batiste. This music is connected to Joe\u2019s professional life and ambition. Batiste\u2019s music is frequently upbeat and catchy, as in \u201cCollard Greens and Cornbread Strut\u201d, the underscoring for Joe\u2019s triumphant stride through city after his successful audition for Dorothea Williams. When he whoops on the street (\u201cYes! Whoo-hoo!\u201d), his voice is part of the music, signifying that the cue is an extension of the diegetic space and merged with his very being. Batiste\u2019s cues show how well Joe musically converses with his new jazz ensemble, and how music carries him into \u201cthe zone\u201d, which 22 defines as \u201cthe space between the physical and the spiritual\u201d. When Joe auditions for Williams, he joins the piece titled \u201cBigger Than Us\u201d. He presses piano chords unsurely at first but then becomes fully part of the ensemble, harmonising with the rest of the quartet: saxophone, double bass, and drum kit. Eventually, he closes his eyes through a solo and the movie visually transports him into an abstract space of blue and shifting lights. The literal environment around him is gone because he has become one with the music. The mise en sc\u00e8ne takes a subsidiary role to the transformational power of the jazz.\n\nThe \u201cepiphany\u201d montage cuts from Joe\u2019s memories to show cityscapes of New York, and then views of planet earth and the galaxy around it, showing me the ambitious outlook of Soul that exceeds all individual human subjectivities. I perceive the filmind of Soul through this macrocosmic vision along with the music that combines styles, which leads me to recognise the fullness of its all-encompassing, nondogmatic perspective. By combining the two forms of dominant music through Soul, \u201cEpiphany\u201d urges me to be more open to and accepting of the hugeness of life that I can never fully understand. With benign ambition, the music invites me to perceive the earthly and unearthly, the quotidian and the transcendent as part of one unified whole. Following this logic, I think of Danijela as part of the Great Beyond rather than simply dead. I feel my own smallness in the scale of the world in which no precious memories or lives are necessarily gone but just positioned differently within it. The film prompts me to fill out the contours of what I can literally see, especially because it musically fills out the abstractness of seeing Joe enter and re-enter the zone. It pulls me into an experience of life and time that is bigger than what can be reduced to an earth-bound existence, a literal understanding, or a realistically detailed mise en sc\u00e8ne.", "extra_context": {"keywords": ["soundtracks", "cinematherapy", "sound studies", "identity", "life", "death", "jazz music", "modern classical music"], "authors": ["Danijela Kulezic-Wilson", "Pete Docter", "Kemp Powers", "Chlo\u00e9 Zhao"], "date": "", "journal": "Alphaville", "license": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License", "contact": "alphavillejournal@gmail.com", "web_editor": "Barry Reilly", "website_design": "Abigail Keating"}}, {"abstract": "Examples of hybridity in the areas of diplomacy, material culture, economic activities, and religion belied European colonists\u2019 stubborn efforts at claimin\n\nC\u00e9line Carayon\nSalisbury University, US\nEmail: cxcarayon@salisbury.edu\n", "extra_context": {"authors": ["C\u00e9line Carayon"], "institution": "Salisbury University, US", "email": "cxcarayon@salisbury.edu", "keywords": [], "date": "", "metrics": {"total_views": 62, "pageviews": 15, "pdf_downloads": 0, "total_citations": 0, "recent_citations": 0}}}, {"abstract": "This exploratory study sought to address the gap in strengthening science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teacher preparation in elementary and secondary teacher education programs.

Providing integrated STEM micro-credentials for preservice and in-service teachers can be a flexible solution for providing teachers a method to learn how to improve their content knowledge and pedagogy (Digital Promise, 2019). Participants were a combination of undergraduate preservice teachers and graduate early-career teachers who were asked about their STEM preparation. The majority of the participants received very little to no integrated STEM preparation. As a possible solution for this, participants were asked about their preferred type of professional development (PD) and if participating in a micro-credential course would be a possibility. Nearly all of the participants agreed that a self-paced micro-credential that blended online and in-person instruction would be something they would do to learn how to integrate STEM more effectively into their pedagogy. Micro-credentials could be a successful solution for educator PD.\n\n---\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nUndergraduate teacher preparation programs are designed around state and national requirements that leave little room, if any, for much-needed new courses to better educate young teachers for the many challenges of the modern classroom. One of the major challenges is to prepare K-12 students for future careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to maintain the United States as one of the world's leading countries for innovation (Twaddle & Smith, 2023). With the added pressure from the U.S. Department of Education to produce the future STEM workforce (Press Office, 2022) along with millions of dollars allocated for grants and government programs, such as the Raise the Bar: STEM Excellence for All Students presidential initiative, preservice teachers need to enter the classroom prepared to build students' foundations in STEM now more than ever (Press Office, 2022). Although critiques suggest that preservice teacher programs should just add additional classes to prepare teachers in STEM (Twaddle & Smith, 2023), this is not always a possibility for several reasons. For one, undergraduate programs can be hesitant to extend students' graduation beyond the 4-year mark. Adding additional classes in STEM would require a longer time for graduation and may also have the opposite effect on students not wanting a 5-year program and would choose a non-teaching major. The current education climate is experiencing a major decline in teachers as well as a decline of college education majors (Lonas, 2023). Additionally, there is a lengthy process to add courses or make changes to a state-approved licensure program. Additions and changes cannot simply be made at the department or college level but must go through several levels of approval at the university and then be approved at the state level. Integrated STEM education is attracting increased attention and gaining momentum from educators, politicians, STEM industries, and the media across the nation. Recent attention has brought to light the low number of students pursuing STEM disciplines and degree programs in the United States, especially among women and minorities (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, 2023; Whitcomb & Singh, 2021). There is a great need in America for talented scientists, engineers, computer scientists, technologists, and mathematicians (Boggs et al., 2022). The National Governors Association has called for a new workforce of problem solvers, innovators, and inventors who are self-reliant and able to think logically, also suggesting that creating such capacity is one of the critical foundations that drive innovative capacity in the nation (Toulmin & Groome, 2007). Aside from the above purpose, introducing K-12 students to science helps them to become more familiar with it and build confidence in their ability to conduct inquiry (DeJarnette, 2018). Jones (2011) states that 75% of all students learn by doing and through inquiry. While mathematical and scientific concepts and processes are encountered spontaneously in students' everyday lives, research has shown that early exposure to STEM initiatives and learning experiences impacts students' perceptions and dispositions toward STEM (Bagiati et al., 2010; DeJarnette, 2012). Greater intentionality is required in pedagogical approaches to build students' conceptual knowledge as well as positive attitudes and dispositions toward STEM (Johnston et al., 2022). Numerous teachers state that they do not have the time to teach individual content areas within STEM since reading and mathematics are emphasized on state testing. In high-needs school districts where test scores often fall well below the national average, there is negligible science instruction (DeJarnette, 2018). One way to combat this problem is through an integrated approach, which STEM lends itself to. A key to developing these skills is strengthening STEM competencies and career goals in every K-12 student. To do this, teachers must be educated on how to integrate STEM content into their curriculum, yet many elementary teacher preparation programs do not provide courses specifically about STEM and much less in secondary majors that do not easily fit into STEM. Another challenge that may be contributing to the lack of STEM in K-12 may be a result of teachers in non-STEM fields who do not accept the responsibility of identifying how their curriculum can contribute to a future career in STEM (Chiangpradit, 2023).\n\n---", "extra_context": {"authors": ["Gina Solano", "Gurupriya Ramanathan"], "date": "2024-09-24", "journal": "Future in Educational Research", "keywords": [], "contact_email": "gxramanathan@salisbury.edu", "orcid": "0000-0002-3957-8219"}}, {"abstract": "Abstract\nMulticultural Feminist Mentoring (MFM) models have provided an important foundation to address the further need for conceptualizing a mentoring model that is specific to Asian/Asian American (A/AA) experiences.

This study examined the types of sources journalists included in 555 text-based solutions journalism articles from the U.S., Europe, and Africa collected from the Solutions Journalism Network. The results indicate solutions stories are meeting the goals set forth by proponents of the movement, as they most frequently include nonprofits/groups and unaffiliated citizens. Solutions stories in American publications contained significantly more non-official sources than did their European and African counterparts, though these sources still comprised the majority of those used across all three continents. However, solutions stories included in the study contained fewer total sources than traditional news articles and still featured government and business sources regularly.

One prevailing perspective (Barnett, Henriques & Husted, 2020; Barnett, Henriques & Husted, 2024) is that digital media leads to slacktivism, a token display of support, which impedes the ability of stakeholders to act collectively and makes it easier for firms to dismiss stakeholder claims. Another perspective (Colleoni, Zyglidopoulos & Illia, 2024) argues that even though synchronicity may be difficult to achieve, digital media in the form of hashtags makes it easier for heterogeneous stakeholders to converge around a broader demand for societal change and indirectly pressure firms to change their policies and practices. In this exchange, we expand on Colleoni, Zyglidopoulos, and Illia\u2019s (2024) arguments by encompassing other forms of digital activism beyond generic hashtags. Drawing from the logic of connective action, we argue that two universal pathways\u2014connectivity and velocity\u2014applicable across a wide range of digital activism, are reshaping and enhancing stakeholders\u2019 ability to influence a firm\u2019s social policies and practices.\n\n**REFERENCES**\nBarnett, M.

In the face of climate variability and continuous human development pressures, this research performs statistical analysis and a wavelet coherence on, before, and after stream restoration for water quality changes in Chesapeake Bay\u2019s tidal tributaries in the Lower Western Shore to identify if the restoration strategies have been effective in the mesohaline tidal creeks. Statistical analysis showed that currently, the receiving tidal basins are not seeing the required positive improvements in water quality after years of upland stream restoration. Compounding this is the fact climate variability cannot be ignored.

The purpose is to report this information so that academics can better understand the behaviors, priorities, and interests of current American students.\n\nBackground\nThis paper investigates the mindset of Generation Z students living in the United States during a period of heightened civic unrest. Through the lens of the Theory of Generations, Uses and Gratifications Theory, and Intersectional Theory, this study aims to examine the Gen Z group and compare findings across populations.\n\nMethodology\nAn electronic survey was administered to students from 2019 through 2022. The survey included a combination of multiple responses, Likert scaled, dichotomous, open-ended, and ordinal questions. It was developed in the Survey Monkey system and reviewed by content and methodological experts to examine bias, vagueness, or potential semantic problems. The survey was pilot-tested in 2018 before implementation in order to explore the efficacy of the research methodology. It was then modified accordingly before widespread distribution to potential participants. The surveys were administered to students enrolled in classes taught by the authors, all of whom are educators. Participation was voluntary, optional, and anonymous.\n\nContribution\nThis paper provides insight into the mindset of Generation Z students living in the United States, which is helpful to members of academia who should be informed about the current generation of students in higher education. Studying Generation Z helps us understand the future and can provide insight into the shifting needs and expectations of society.\n\nFindings\nAccording to the findings, Gen Z are heavy users of digital technologies who use social media as their primary source for gathering news about current events as well as information for schoolwork. The majority of respondents considered themselves to be social activists. When institutional type was considered, there were notable differences with the students at the Historically Black College or University (HBCU), noting the greatest concern with a number of pressing issues, including racial justice/Black Lives Matter, women\u2019s rights, gun violence, immigration reform, and human trafficking. Less significance across groups was found when LGBTQIA+ rights and climate change were considered.\n\nRecommendation for Researchers\nAs social media continues to proliferate in daily life and become a vital means of news and information gathering, additional studies such as the one presented here are needed.

With over a million professionals from Asia entering the US labor market in the past decade, a potential under placement may be both inefficient and discriminatory. We collected data on all newly hired assistant professors of management in research-intensive (R1) universities in the USA between 2010 and 2021. We focus on the quality of the university into which first hires are placed and examine whether first-job placement quality is lower for individuals who were born in East, South and Southeast Asia. We find that the quality and quantity of publication record are positively related to the quality of the placement and that Asian nationals have higher performance. However, Asian nationals are placed at lower-quality universities relative to their peers. Further, Asian nationals require a strong performance signal, in the form of first or second authorship on a publication to narrow the placement gap. Our results are explained by a combination of direct bias against applicants of Asian nationality and a requirement of a higher performance \u201cburden of proof\u201d from these applicants, compared to peers who are non-Asian nationals.\n\n### Biographies  \n**Amit Kramer** is an associate professor at the School of Labor and Employment Relations.

Two thirds of faculty perceived the severity of COVID-19 as severe, and their greatest concerns related to preventive behaviors, the possibility of a virus resurgence, and concern for the health of family/friends. The majority reported frequently engaging in COVID-19-preventing behaviors, which was highest among female and older faculty, and those with higher perceived severity and concern for personally contracting the virus. Over half of respondents reported teaching and scholarly activities were negatively impacted by the pandemic; most notable barriers to productivity included anxiety/stress and a distracted home environment.

Adults living in urban counties compared with rural counties had a greater prevalence of LT bicycling (3.9% vs 2.3%, respectively), with adults living in rural counties having a 34% lower probability of LT bicycling. Rural bicycling prevalence rates were lower across all demographics. Urban bicyclists, compared with rural bicyclists, cycled more months of the year. Overall, 85.5% of all bicyclists met the aerobic physical guidelines, with no differences between urban and rural bicyclists.\n\n## Conclusions\nBicycling remains an important LT physical activity among adults in the United States.

This study aimed to examine the trends and outcomes of opioid overdose hospitalizations in Pennsylvania during 2018 to 2021.\n\nDesign: We identified opioid overdose hospitalizations in the state of Pennsylvania using the state-wide hospital discharge database (PHC4) 2018 to 2021. We examined the number of opioid overdose hospitalizations, the corresponding mortality and discharges against medical advice comparing the pre-COVID period (2018-2019) and the COVID period (2020-2021). We also assessed what patient and hospital characteristics were associated with in-hospital death or leaving against medical advice.\n\nResults: A total of 13,446 opioid-related hospitalizations were identified in 2018 to 2021. Compared to pre-pandemic, a higher percentage of cases involving synthetics (17.0% vs 10.3%, P < .0001) were observed during COVID. After controlling for covariates, there was no significant difference in opioid overdose in-hospital deaths in the years 2020 to 2021 compared to 2018 to 2019 (OR = 0.846, 95% CI: 0.71-1.01, P = .065). The COVID period was significantly associated with more leaving against medical advice compared to years 2018 to 2019 (OR = 1.265, 95% CI: 1.11-1.44, P = .0003).\n\n**Conclusion**: There were no substantial changes in the number of overall opioid overdose cases and deaths at hospitals following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania. This observation suggests that an increased number of patients may have succumbed to overdoses outside of hospital settings, possibly due to a higher severity of overdoses. Further, we found that patients were more likely to leave against medical advice during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Keywords**: Opioid overdose, hospitalization, COVID-19", "extra_context": {"authors": ["Chan Shen", "James Douglas Thornton", "Ning Li", "Shouhao Zhou", "Li Wang", "Douglas L.

Thirty resistance-trained males (age: 22 \u00b1 2 years; weight: 74.4 \u00b1 13.6 kg; height: 177.4 \u00b1 6.4 cm; BMI: 23.5 \u00b1 3.3 kg/m2) participated. Each performed exercise to failure (4 sets, 30% 1RM, 1 min rest) in three conditions: Supine LOP-BFR, Seated LOP-BFR, and no-BFR. BFR was applied at 60% LOP. Significant interaction effects were found for RPE (p = 0.021, d = 0.76), RPD (p < 0.01, d = 1.72), and DOMS (p < 0.01, d = 2.28). Statistically significant fewer repetitions were completed in Supine LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.5), Seated LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 1.0), and Seated LOP-BFR vs. Supine LOP-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.6). RPE was higher in Seated LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.52). RPD was higher in Supine LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.62) and Seated LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 1.25). DOMS was higher in Supine LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.77) and Seated LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 3.52). Seated LOP-BFR increased perceptual demands and reduced repetitions compared to Supine LOP-BFR.

Molecular approaches were used to assess the geographic ranges of four North American species, the frequency at which they occur sympatrically, and ecological differentiation among them. Microhabitats were classified with regard to hydrology and shade. Hierarchical modelling of species communities was used to assess climate variation among the species. Climate niches were projected back to 22,000 years BP to assess the likelihood that the North American species had sympatric ranges during the late Pleistocene.\n\n## Results\nThe species exhibited parallel morphological variation, making them extremely difficult to distinguish phenotypically. Two to three species frequently co-occurred within peatlands. They had broadly overlapping microhabitat and climate niches. Barcode- versus RADseq-based identifications were in conflict for 6% of the samples and always involved S. diabolicum vs. S. magniae.\n\n## Conclusions\nThese species co-occur within peatlands at scales that could permit interbreeding, yet they remain largely distinct genetically and phylogenetically. The four cryptic species exhibited distinct geographic and ecological patterns. Conflicting identifications from barcode vs. RADseq analyses for S. diabolicum versus S. magniae could reflect incomplete speciation or hybridization. They comprise a valuable study system for additional work on climate adaptation.\n\n## Open Research\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nSpecies microniche data are deposited on GitHub: https://github.com/dinilu/Sphagnum_magellanicum_complex.

The efficacy of prior machine learning techniques is dwarfed by giant variations of data collected from multiple participants, partly because users have varied chewing habits and wear sensor devices in various manners. This work treats the problem as an instance of the domain adaptation problem, where each user represents a domain. We develop the first multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) method for food-typing recognition, which consists of three major components: stratified normalization, a multi-source domain adaptor, and adaptive ensemble learning. New techniques are developed for each component. Using a real-world dataset comprised of 15 participants, we demonstrate that our method achieves 1.33x to 2.13x improvement in accuracy compared with nine state-of-the-art MSDA baselines. Additionally, we perform an in-depth ablation study to examine the behavior of each component and confirm their efficacy.\n\n**Keywords:** Food Type Recognition, Multi-Source Domain Adaptation, Stratified Normalization, Adaptive Ensemble\n\n**Index Terms:** Computing methodologies, Artificial intelligence, Computer vision, Computer vision problems, Machine learning, Learning paradigms, Human-centered computing, Human computer interaction (HCI), Security and privacy, Security services, Authentication.", "extra_context": {"authors": ["Jiexiong Guan", "Junjie Wang", "Wei Niu", "Zhen Peng", "Shuangquan Wang", "Zhenming Liu", "Gang Zhou", "Bin Ren"], "date": "2024-08-28", "journal": "ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare", "eISSN": "2637-8051", "total_citations": 0, "total_downloads_last_12_months": 90, "total_downloads_last_6_weeks": 40, "abstract_available": true}}]
