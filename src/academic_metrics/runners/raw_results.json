Investigations into specific behaviors and practices that influence arterial stiffness has been a priority in the past few years. Chronic aerobic and anaerobic exercise activity has consistently shown to attenuate or not influence markers of arterial stiffness in adults with chronic disease and otherwise healthy adults. Chronic high functional resistance training\u2019s effect on vascular compliance is less understood.\nPURPOSE: To determine the effects of a chronic high functional resistance training program on pulse wave velocity and beta-stiffness index.\nMETHODS: Participants (18-40 years old) were placed in a non-randomized fashion into high functional resistance training (HFRT) group (n = 9; >6 months of CrossFit experience; 4 female), or control (CON) group (n = 8; < 6 months of exercise experience; 6 female). Participants in the HFRT group trained at the same local facility 4 -5 days a week, utilizing the same training program. CON group refrained from exercise during the study period. Body composition, 1,000 meter rowing test, deadlift 1 repetition maximum (1 RM), hemodynamic assessments and vascular compliance was assessed at baseline and follow-up. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to examine within and between interactions on indices of arterial stiffness.\nRESULTS: There were baseline differences between groups in deadlift 1 RM (72.3 \u00b1 18.2 kg mean difference (MD), p < 0.01), rowing time (143.8 \u00b1 35.7 sec MD, p < 0.01), and rowing average watts (153.8 \u00b1 34.6 watts MD, p < 0.01). Following the intervention, seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increased only in the CON group (3 \u00b1 4 mmHg MD, p = 0.04). No significant differences within and between group interactions were found in arterial stiffness variables.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate indices of arterial stiffness are not influenced by participation in chronic high functional resistance training.

The impact of this type of training on arterial stiffness is less understood.\n\nPURPOSE: To investigate the acute effects of autoregulated (AR) and non-autoregulated (NAR) BFR exercise on indices of arterial stiffness. AR BFR training devices adjust pressure in the cuff ensuring similar pressure throughout the range of motion when the muscles are contracted (dilatated) and relaxed. NAR BFR training devices do not adjust pressure in the cuff throughout the range of motion when the muscles are contracted and relaxed which cause greater pressures at different points in the range of motion.\n\nMETHODS: Following a randomized AR or NAR familiarization training session, 20 adults (23 \u00b1 5 years; 7 female) participated in 3 randomized treatment-order sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no-BFR separated by 1-week washout periods. Participants performed 4 sets of dumbbell wall squats to failure using 20% of 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) at 2-second concentric/eccentric cadence. Pneumatic straps were placed around the proximal portion of each thigh and training limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both the AT and NAR sessions. Testing before and immediately following the training session included ultrasonography of the carotid artery, applanation tonometry, and blood pressure acquisition. Two-way ANOVAs were used to examine the effects of treatment and the treatment-order interaction on pulse wave velocity (PWV), beta-stiffness index (\u03b2-stiff), and arterial compliance (AC).\n\nRESULTS: There were no baseline differences in CF- (carotid-femoral) PWV, CR- (carotid-radial) PWV, \u03b2-stiff, and AC (all p > 0.05). CF-PWV increased in the NAR-BFR (mean difference = 0.57 \u00b1 1.12 m/s, p = 0.02) and no-BFR (mean difference = 0.63 \u00b1 1.42 m/s, p = 0.03) groups following the exercise session. CR-PWV increased in the no-BFR (mean difference = 0.82 \u00b1 1.5 m/s, p = 0.03) group. And there was an interaction effect in CF-PWV between AR-BFR and NAR-BFR (mean difference = 0.70 \u00b1 1.6 m/s, p = 0.03).\n\nCONCLUSION: These findings show acute AR-BFR training does not influence indices of arterial stiffness while acute NAR-BFR training increases central stiffness.\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 by the American College of Sports Medicine\nView full article text", "extra_context": {"keywords": ["Blood Flow Restriction", "Arterial Stiffness", "Exercise"], "authors": ["Tim Werner", "Nicholas Rolnick", "Nicholas Licameli", "Masoud Moghaddam", "Lisa Marquette", "Jessica Walter", "Brent Fedorko"], "date": "September 2023", "journal": "Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise", "volume": "55", "issue": "9S", "pages": "51-52", "doi": "10.1249/01.mss.0000980200.41641.da"}}, {"abstract": "These findings describe a novel model of motor nerve regeneration following hyperglycemic injury in zebrafish larvae.\nHyperglycemia severely impairs vertebral development, which persists following recovery. \n\n## Abstract\n### Background\nPrevious work from our lab has described a model of motor nerve degeneration in hyperglycemic zebrafish larvae which resembles mammalian models of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Here, we optimized the hyperglycemic-induction protocol, characterized deficits in nerve structure and behavioral function, and then examined the regenerative potential following recovery from the hyperglycemic state.\n### Results\nIn agreement with our previous work, hyperglycemia induced motor nerve degeneration and behavioral deficits. However, the optimized protocol initiated disruption of tight junctions within the blood-nerve barrier, a phenotype apparent in mammalian models of DPN. Following a 10-day recovery period, regeneration of motor nerve components was apparent, but behavioral deficits persisted. We next examined the effect of hyperglycemia on the musculoskeletal system and found subtle deficits in muscle that resolved following recovery, and robust deficits in the skeletal system which persisted following recovery.\n### Conclusion\nHere we optimized our previous model of hyperglycemia-induced motor nerve degeneration to more closely align with that observed in mammalian models and then characterized the regenerative potential following recovery from hyperglycemia. Notably, we observed striking impairments to skeletal development, which underscores the global impact hyperglycemia has across systems, and provides a framework for elucidating molecular mechanisms responsible for regenerative events moving forward.\n\n## 1 INTRODUCTION\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, which are associated with numerous comorbidities including retinopathy, nephropathies, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease. The most common complication of DM is diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), which affects ~50% of diabetic patients and often leads to sensory and motor nerve impairment. While humans do have the potential for peripheral nerve regeneration, chronic hyperglycemia is a suboptimal condition for regenerative events. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying DPN has tremendous therapeutic potential, however, this has proven to be technically challenging to study in mammalian models. For this reason, our lab has approached this using *Danio rerio* (zebrafish), as they are already recognized as a viable model system for studying diabetic complications because of similarities in development, physiology, and glucoregulation compared to mammals. Furthermore, because of their optical transparency and fluorescent transgenes, degeneration and regeneration can be easily visualized in vivo during larval stages. Therefore, we have concentrated our efforts on establishing a model of hyperglycemia-induced nerve degeneration in zebrafish larvae that could be exploited to determine the underlying molecular pathways involved. To that end, we have characterized hyperglycemia-induced nerve degeneration in zebrafish larvae using two approaches: chemical-genetic pancreatic \u03b2-cell ablation and 60 mM glucose-immersion. In both models, hyperglycemia is initiated 5 days post-fertilization (dpf), with a hyperglycemic period of 2 days in the ablation model (limited by the remarkable ability of pancreatic \u03b2-cell regeneration in zebrafish and reduced survivability with subsequent ablations), and 5 days in the 60 mM glucose-immersion model. Both approaches result in nerve degeneration that resembles DPN in humans, including motor axon defasciculation, decreased myelination, and loss of perineurial ensheathment. Analogous to DPN in humans, the severity of damage appears to be dependent on the length of the hyperglycemic period. For example, in zebrafish, deficits in escape response are observed with the longer hyperglycemic period in the 60 mM glucose-immersion model, but are absent in the shorter hyperglycemic period inherent to the ablation model. Therefore, we have focused our work on the glucose-immersion model to further characterize hyperglycemia-induced degeneration, and subsequent regeneration, of peripheral nerves in zebrafish larvae.\nOf particular interest to our work is the perineurium; this critical component of the blood-nerve-barrier is conserved between mammals and zebrafish, and plays a dynamic role in the regeneration of acutely injured nerves in zebrafish. Furthermore, changes to the perineurium in a hyperglycemic state have been well described in human patients and rodent models of DPN; more specifically, the arrangement of tight junctions between perineurial cells appear abnormal and an overall reduction in gap junctions is observed. The increased permeability that results from these alterations may be an initial step in the pathogenesis of DPN as it leaves peripheral axons exposed to unwanted molecular infiltration. In our 60 mM glucose-immersion model, we observe dramatic decreases in the percentage of motor nerves ensheathed by the perineurium, as well as the degree to which the remaining nerves are ensheathed by the perineurium. However, of the perineurial glia that persist, the arrangement of tight junctions between these cells appear unaffected. In the current work, we optimized the concentration and length of glucose treatment, based on a published survival assay, in an effort to recapitulate the defects in tight junctions observed in mammalian models. We then introduced a 10-day recovery period from glucose treatment to allow for a return to a euglycemic state. While significant regeneration of peripheral nerve components was apparent, behavioral deficits persisted. We hypothesized that deficits in the development of the musculoskeletal system may contribute to the behavioral deficits observed. Indeed, subtle defects in muscle were observed in hyperglycemic larvae, however, following the recovery period, muscle appeared comparable to control muscle. Analysis of skeletal structures showed a robust impairment of skeletal development within the vertebral column of hyperglycemic larvae that persisted beyond the recovery period. The contribution of skeletal deficits to the persistent behavioral deficits requires further exploration but emphasizes the global nature of hyperglycemia and the need to encompass a variety of structures in the investigation of widespread and chronic hyperglycemic injuries.\n\n## 2 RESULTS\n### 2.1 Optimized protocol more closely recapitulates defects observed in mammalian models of DPN\nThe Clark lab has previously characterized a model of hyperglycemia-induced peripheral nerve degeneration; incubation in 60 mM glucose for 5 days results in motor nerve degeneration, ectopic sensory neuron localization, and behavioral deficits. Because the blood-nerve-barrier may have therapeutic potential, there was particular interest in the perineurium; following incubation in 60 mM glucose for 5 days, the percentage of motor nerves ensheathed by the perineurial glia, and the length of ensheathment decreases. Of the perineurial glia that persist, tight junctions appear unaffected, which is inconsistent with observations in other models of hyperglycemia. Because the duration and severity of hyperglycemia contributes to the severity of diabetic complications in humans, we optimized the treatment protocol to reflect this in an effort to more closely recapitulate defects observed in human DPN. Based on survival assay data described in our previous work, which demonstrates no increase in lethality associated with these conditions, the optimized protocol doubled the concentration of glucose and extended the hyperglycemic period an additional 2 days. Beginning 5 dpf, larvae were placed in 120 mM glucose solution until 12 dpf (Tx12). The control group (C12) was placed in egg water (Instant Ocean and reverse osmosis water) for the same period. To ensure hyperglycemic induction, whole-body glucose was measured at 12 dpf. Tx12 fish had an increased whole-body glucose concentration compared to C12 fish. \n\n## Extra Context\n### Keywords\n- zebrafish\n- motor nerve regeneration\n- hyperglycemia\n- diabetic peripheral neuropathy\n\n### Authors\n- Sheridan Sargent (orcid.org/0000-0002-1205-8838)\n- Anna Brennan (orcid.org/0000-0003-3896-1985)\n- Jessica Kennett Clark (orcid.org/0000-0001-8714-9884)\n\n### Date\n- First published: 06 March 2023\n\n### Journal\n- Developmental Dynamics, Volume 252, Issue 6, Pages 742-760\n\n### Contribution\n- Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology\n\n### Contact\n- Corresponding Author Email: jkclark@salisbury.edu", "extra_context": {"keywords": ["zebrafish", "motor nerve regeneration", "hyperglycemia", "diabetic peripheral neuropathy"], "authors": ["Sheridan Sargent (orcid.org/0000-0002-1205-8838)", "Anna Brennan (orcid.org/0000-0003-3896-1985)", "Jessica Kennett Clark (orcid.org/0000-0001-8714-9884)"], "date": "06 March 2023", "journal": "Developmental Dynamics, Volume 252, Issue 6, Pages 742-760", "contribution": "Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology", "contact": "Corresponding Author Email: jkclark@salisbury.edu"}}]
