AB In this meta-analysis, we examine the relationship between fear and the three facets of work performance, namely task performance, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), and counterproductive work behavior (CWB). We integrated the disparate literature by establishing a unifying theoretical framework informed by the resource-based perspective. Results showed that fear is negatively related to task performance and OCB, and positively related to CWB. In addition, the negative relationship between fear and OCB is stronger for OCBs directed toward the organization (OCB-O) than OCBs directed toward individuals (OCB-I). The positive relationship between fear and CWB is stronger in male dominated samples and countries with high religiosity. Furthermore, stress mediated the effects of fear on task performance, OCB, and CWB. We note the theoretical and practical implications in light of the study findings, and discuss study limitations and future research needs.
