AB Feeding morphology permits animals to adapt to changing environments and is often under strong selection. We evaluated if bill shape varies according to differences in dietary prey taken across geographical ranges (North America, Central America, South America, and Caribbean islands) in a ubiquitous, New World raptor species, the American kestrel (Falco sparverius). Specifically, we predicted that bills in geographies where kestrels consumed a larger proportion of vertebrates would be shorter and wider, with a larger tomial tooth. We reviewed the literature on kestrel diets across their range and quantified potential differences in bill shape using geometric morphometric methods for 245 museum specimens. The literature review revealed that most prey consumed by kestrels in North, South, and Central America were invertebrates (51.6-69.1%), whereas Caribbean kestrels consumed mostly vertebrates (61.4%), most of which were reptiles (77.3%). Morphometric analyses agreed with these findings; bill shape differed for island versus mainland kestrels but not among mainland regions. Bill shape on islands reflected a more robust bill with a larger tomial tooth, but had a longer hook, which we suggest is adaptive for consumption of lizard prey, more available on islands due to reduced competition with other raptors compared to mainland regions.
