AB In this paper, we use the well-documented mutual fund flow-performance relationship to infer information about investors' preferences. We show that applying preference parameter values from experimental settings to market data can significantly understate the role of prospect theory in explaining investor behavior. We find evidence that mutual fund investors exhibit loss aversion and differential attitudes toward risk over losses (risk-seeking) and gains (risk-averse) but no significant probability weighting when evaluating fund performance. Our results apply more strongly to retail funds compared to institutional funds, consistent with the view that prospect theory is more relevant for retail investors. Finally, we show that, for parameter values that best explain fund flows, prospect theory outperforms the global risk aversion framework and widely-used asset pricing models in explaining investors' responses to fund performance.
