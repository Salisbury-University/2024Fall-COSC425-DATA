AB Using data from long jump competitions from IAAF World Championships and Olympics from 2005 to 2017, we find evidence that interim rank is an important determinant of risk-taking and that ranking information can impact risktaking in different ways across gender. An athlete's rank relative to (1) their peers' performances, (2) their own ability, and (3) their peers' abilities all appear to be important in different scenarios.
