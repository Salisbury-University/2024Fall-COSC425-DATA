The aims of this study were to 1) Examine the relationship between locomotion and physical performance tests and the timed supine to stand performance measure and to 2) Identify both the time required and predominant motor patterns utilized by persons with PD to complete to floor rise transition. A cross-sectional design was utilized. Twenty community-dwelling older adults with PD (mean age 74.8+/-9.5 years; 13 men) performed a standardized floor rise test and locomotion tests in a structured task circuit. Subject demographic and anthropometric data were also collected. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and Pearson Product Moment correlations. Fifteen subjects (75%) demonstrated the crouch kneel pattern and fourteen (70%) used an all-4\u2019s strategy to rise to stand. The mean time to rise from the floor was 14.9 (+/- 7.6) seconds and slower than published norms for persons without PD. Nine subjects required the use of a chair to perform floor recovery. Supine to stand performance time was significantly correlated with the: Dynamic Gait Index (r= - 0.66; p&lt;0.002), Five Times Sit to Stand Test (r=0.78; p&lt;0.001), Timed Up and Go Test (r=0.74; p&lt;0.001), and gait velocity (r= -0.77; p&lt;0.001). Rising from the floor demonstrates concurrent validity with locomotion and physical performance tests. Floor recovery techniques can be incorporated in fall prevention initiatives in conjunction with PD symptom management.\n",

Guest speakers share their expertise on selected issues, otherwise students alternate leading discussions on remaining topics. There are three focused reflections on assigned experiences which include conducting a videotaped interview with a retired community-based older adult, attending a support group or senior center activity, and visiting a center to view various physical/technological adaptive aids that maintain mobility and independence in the home. There is also a culminating research paper on an issue of their choice. Student evaluations are overwhelmingly positive; comments include gaining in-depth knowledge about the unique needs of this population and the importance of healthy aging with an emphasis on a positive, inter-professional approach to care. It is incumbent upon educators to better prepare students to recognize ageist attitudes, as well as address the significant impact of this \u201clongevity revolution\u201d.\n",

        "abstract": "While considerable research has targeted gait, balance and preventing falls in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), less in known about the ability to rise from the floor in this population. The aims of this study were to 1) Examine the relationship between locomotion and physical performance tests and the timed supine to stand performance measure and to 2) Identify both the time required and predominant motor patterns utilized by persons with PD to complete to floor rise transition. A cross-sectional design was utilized. Twenty community-dwelling older adults with PD (mean age 74.8+/-9.5 years; 13 men) performed a standardized floor rise test and locomotion tests in a structured task circuit. Subject demographic and anthropometric data were also collected. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and Pearson Product Moment correlations. Fifteen subjects (75%) demonstrated the crouch kneel pattern and fourteen (70%) used an all-4\u2019s strategy to rise to stand. The mean time to rise from the floor was 14.9 (+/- 7.6) seconds and slower than published norms for persons without PD. Nine subjects required the use of a chair to perform floor recovery. Supine to stand performance time was significantly correlated with the: Dynamic Gait Index (r= - 0.66; p&lt;0.002), Five Times Sit to Stand Test (r=0.78; p&lt;0.001), Timed Up and Go Test (r=0.74; p&lt;0.001), and gait velocity (r= -0.77; p&lt;0.001). Rising from the floor demonstrates concurrent validity with locomotion and physical performance tests. Floor recovery techniques can be incorporated in fall prevention initiatives in conjunction with PD symptom management.\n",

This population shift is expected to place unprecedented demands on the healthcare system in terms of both volume and complexity of care. Given these population shifts and emphasis on an interdisciplinary approach to care, a 4-credit Honors aging course was developed for Honors students in nursing and other health-related majors. Aging Reexamined, Reimagined is offered in a discussion/seminar format with limited enrollment to allow for deep reflective discourse about pertinent issues affecting older adults.

Guest speakers share their expertise on selected issues, otherwise students alternate leading discussions on remaining topics. There are three focused reflections on assigned experiences which include conducting a videotaped interview with a retired community-based older adult, attending a support group or senior center activity, and visiting a center to view various physical/technological adaptive aids that maintain mobility and independence in the home. There is also a culminating research paper on an issue of their choice. Student evaluations are overwhelmingly positive; comments include gaining in-depth knowledge about the unique needs of this population and the importance of healthy aging with an emphasis on a positive, inter-professional approach to care.

        "abstract": "With the aging of Baby Boomers, 2030 will mark the first time in U.S. history that those aged 65 and older will outnumber children. This population shift is expected to place unprecedented demands on the healthcare system in terms of both volume and complexity of care. Given these population shifts and emphasis on an interdisciplinary approach to care, a 4-credit Honors aging course was developed for Honors students in nursing and other health-related majors. Aging Reexamined, Reimagined is offered in a discussion/seminar format with limited enrollment to allow for deep reflective discourse about pertinent issues affecting older adults. Topics include physical/cognitive changes, ageism, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, sexuality, aging in place, polypharmacy, addiction, depression, caregiving, elder justice, and end-of-life care. Guest speakers share their expertise on selected issues, otherwise students alternate leading discussions on remaining topics. There are three focused reflections on assigned experiences which include conducting a videotaped interview with a retired community-based older adult, attending a support group or senior center activity, and visiting a center to view various physical/technological adaptive aids that maintain mobility and independence in the home. There is also a culminating research paper on an issue of their choice. Student evaluations are overwhelmingly positive; comments include gaining in-depth knowledge about the unique needs of this population and the importance of healthy aging with an emphasis on a positive, inter-professional approach to care. It is incumbent upon educators to better prepare students to recognize ageist attitudes, as well as address the significant impact of this \u201clongevity revolution\u201d.\n",

The aims of this study were to 1) Examine the relationship between locomotion and physical performance tests and the timed supine to stand performance measure and to 2) Identify both the time required and predominant motor patterns utilized by persons with PD to complete to floor rise transition. A cross-sectional design was utilized. Twenty community-dwelling older adults with PD (mean age 74.8+/-9.5 years; 13 men) performed a standardized floor rise test and locomotion tests in a structured task circuit. Subject demographic and anthropometric data were also collected. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and Pearson Product Moment correlations. Fifteen subjects (75%) demonstrated the crouch kneel pattern and fourteen (70%) used an all-4\u2019s strategy to rise to stand. The mean time to rise from the floor was 14.9 (+/- 7.6) seconds and slower than published norms for persons without PD. Nine subjects required the use of a chair to perform floor recovery. Supine to stand performance time was significantly correlated with the: Dynamic Gait Index (r= - 0.66; p&lt;0.002), Five Times Sit to Stand Test (r=0.78; p&lt;0.001), Timed Up and Go Test (r=0.74; p&lt;0.001), and gait velocity (r= -0.77; p&lt;0.001). Rising from the floor demonstrates concurrent validity with locomotion and physical performance tests. Floor recovery techniques can be incorporated in fall prevention initiatives in conjunction with PD symptom management.\n",

        "abstract": "The black-winged subterranean termite, Odontotermes formosanus Shiraki, is a severe pest of plantations and forests in China. This termite cultures symbiotic Termitomyces in the fungal combs, which are challenged by antagonistic microbes such as Trichoderma fungi. In a previous study we showed that O. formosanus workers made significantly fewer tunnels in sand containing commercially formulated conidia of Trichoderma viride Pers. ex Fries compared with untreated sand. Herein, we hypothesize that fungi in the genus Trichoderma exert repellent effects on O. formosanus. Different choice tests were conducted to evaluate the tunneling and aggregation behaviors of O. formosanus workers reacting to sand/soil containing the unformulated conidia of seven Trichoderma fungi (Trichoderma longibrachiatum Rifai, Trichoderma koningii Oud., Trichoderma harzianum Rifai, Trichoderma hamatum (Bon.) Bain, Trichoderma atroviride Karsten, Trichoderma spirale Indira and Kamala, and T. viride). We also investigated the colony-initiation preference of paired O. formosanus adults to soil treated with Trichoderma conidia (T. koningii or T. longibrachiatum) versus untreated soil. Tunneling-choice tests showed that sand containing conidia of nearly all Trichoderma fungi tested (except T. harzianum) significantly decreased tunneling activity in O. formosanus workers compared with untreated sand. Aggregation-choice test showed that T. koningii, T. atroviride and T. spirale repelled O. formosanus workers, whereas T. longibrachiatum and T. hamatum attracted termites. There was no significant difference in proportions of paired adults that stayed and laid eggs in the soil blocks treated with conidia of Trichoderma fungi and untreated ones. Our study showed that Trichoderma fungi generally repelled tunneling in O. formosanus, but may exert varied effects on aggregation preference by workers.\n",

Supine to stand performance time was significantly correlated with the: Dynamic Gait Index (r= - 0.66; p&lt;0.002), Five Times Sit to Stand Test (r=0.78; p&lt;0.001), Timed Up and Go Test (r=0.74; p&lt;0.001), and gait velocity (r= -0.77; p&lt;0.001). Rising from the floor demonstrates concurrent validity with locomotion and physical performance tests. Floor recovery techniques can be incorporated in fall prevention initiatives in conjunction with PD symptom management.\n",

The aims of this study were to 1) Examine the relationship between locomotion and physical performance tests and the timed supine to stand performance measure and to 2) Identify both the time required and predominant motor patterns utilized by persons with PD to complete to floor rise transition. A cross-sectional design was utilized. Twenty community-dwelling older adults with PD (mean age 74.8+/-9.5 years; 13 men) performed a standardized floor rise test and locomotion tests in a structured task circuit. Subject demographic and anthropometric data were also collected. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and Pearson Product Moment correlations. Fifteen subjects (75%) demonstrated the crouch kneel pattern and fourteen (70%) used an all-4\u2019s strategy to rise to stand. The mean time to rise from the floor was 14.9 (+/- 7.6) seconds and slower than published norms for persons without PD. Nine subjects required the use of a chair to perform floor recovery. Supine to stand performance time was significantly correlated with the: Dynamic Gait Index (r= - 0.66; p&lt;0.002), Five Times Sit to Stand Test (r=0.78; p&lt;0.001), Timed Up and Go Test (r=0.74; p&lt;0.001), and gait velocity (r= -0.77; p&lt;0.001). Rising from the floor demonstrates concurrent validity with locomotion and physical performance tests. Floor recovery techniques can be incorporated in fall prevention initiatives in conjunction with PD symptom management.\n",

        "abstract": "The black-winged subterranean termite, Odontotermes formosanus Shiraki, is a severe pest of plantations and forests in China. This termite cultures symbiotic Termitomyces in the fungal combs, which are challenged by antagonistic microbes such as Trichoderma fungi. In a previous study we showed that O. formosanus workers made significantly fewer tunnels in sand containing commercially formulated conidia of Trichoderma viride Pers. ex Fries compared with untreated sand. Herein, we hypothesize that fungi in the genus Trichoderma exert repellent effects on O. formosanus. Different choice tests were conducted to evaluate the tunneling and aggregation behaviors of O. formosanus workers reacting to sand/soil containing the unformulated conidia of seven Trichoderma fungi (Trichoderma longibrachiatum Rifai, Trichoderma koningii Oud., Trichoderma harzianum Rifai, Trichoderma hamatum (Bon.) Bain, Trichoderma atroviride Karsten, Trichoderma spirale Indira and Kamala, and T. viride). We also investigated the colony-initiation preference of paired O. formosanus adults to soil treated with Trichoderma conidia (T. koningii or T. longibrachiatum) versus untreated soil. Tunneling-choice tests showed that sand containing conidia of nearly all Trichoderma fungi tested (except T. harzianum) significantly decreased tunneling activity in O. formosanus workers compared with untreated sand. Aggregation-choice test showed that T. koningii, T. atroviride and T. spirale repelled O. formosanus workers, whereas T. longibrachiatum and T. hamatum attracted termites. There was no significant difference in proportions of paired adults that stayed and laid eggs in the soil blocks treated with conidia of Trichoderma fungi and untreated ones. Our study showed that Trichoderma fungi generally repelled tunneling in O. formosanus, but may exert varied effects on aggregation preference by workers.\n",

        "abstract": "The black-winged subterranean termite, Odontotermes formosanus Shiraki, is a severe pest of plantations and forests in China. This termite cultures symbiotic Termitomyces in the fungal combs, which are challenged by antagonistic microbes such as Trichoderma fungi. In a previous study we showed that O. formosanus workers made significantly fewer tunnels in sand containing commercially formulated conidia of Trichoderma viride Pers. ex Fries compared with untreated sand. Herein, we hypothesize that fungi in the genus Trichoderma exert repellent effects on O. formosanus. Different choice tests were conducted to evaluate the tunneling and aggregation behaviors of O. formosanus workers reacting to sand/soil containing the unformulated conidia of seven Trichoderma fungi (Trichoderma longibrachiatum Rifai, Trichoderma koningii Oud., Trichoderma harzianum Rifai, Trichoderma hamatum (Bon.) Bain, Trichoderma atroviride Karsten, Trichoderma spirale Indira and Kamala, and T. viride). We also investigated the colony-initiation preference of paired O. formosanus adults to soil treated with Trichoderma conidia (T. koningii or T. longibrachiatum) versus untreated soil. Tunneling-choice tests showed that sand containing conidia of nearly all Trichoderma fungi tested (except T. harzianum) significantly decreased tunneling activity in O. formosanus workers compared with untreated sand. Aggregation-choice test showed that T. koningii, T. atroviride and T. spirale repelled O. formosanus workers, whereas T. longibrachiatum and T. hamatum attracted termites. There was no significant difference in proportions of paired adults that stayed and laid eggs in the soil blocks treated with conidia of Trichoderma fungi and untreated ones. Our study showed that Trichoderma fungi generally repelled tunneling in O. formosanus, but may exert varied effects on aggregation preference by workers.\n",

        "abstract": "The black-winged subterranean termite, Odontotermes formosanus Shiraki, is a severe pest of plantations and forests in China. This termite cultures symbiotic Termitomyces in the fungal combs, which are challenged by antagonistic microbes such as Trichoderma fungi. In a previous study we showed that O. formosanus workers made significantly fewer tunnels in sand containing commercially formulated conidia of Trichoderma viride Pers. ex Fries compared with untreated sand. Herein, we hypothesize that fungi in the genus Trichoderma exert repellent effects on O. formosanus. Different choice tests were conducted to evaluate the tunneling and aggregation behaviors of O. formosanus workers reacting to sand/soil containing the unformulated conidia of seven Trichoderma fungi (Trichoderma longibrachiatum Rifai, Trichoderma koningii Oud., Trichoderma harzianum Rifai, Trichoderma hamatum (Bon.) Bain, Trichoderma atroviride Karsten, Trichoderma spirale Indira and Kamala, and T. viride). We also investigated the colony-initiation preference of paired O. formosanus adults to soil treated with Trichoderma conidia (T. koningii or T. longibrachiatum) versus untreated soil. Tunneling-choice tests showed that sand containing conidia of nearly all Trichoderma fungi tested (except T. harzianum) significantly decreased tunneling activity in O. formosanus workers compared with untreated sand. Aggregation-choice test showed that T. koningii, T. atroviride and T. spirale repelled O. formosanus workers, whereas T. longibrachiatum and T. hamatum attracted termites. There was no significant difference in proportions of paired adults that stayed and laid eggs in the soil blocks treated with conidia of Trichoderma fungi and untreated ones. Our study showed that Trichoderma fungi generally repelled tunneling in O. formosanus, but may exert varied effects on aggregation preference by workers.\n",
