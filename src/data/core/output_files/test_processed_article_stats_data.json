Undergraduate women ( n\u2009=\u2009658) completed the Rape Victim Empathy-During Subscale and Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization. Rape experience was associated with greater empathy, especially for those with any forcible experience. Perhaps due to weaker memory of their own rape event, incapacitated victims may be relatively less able than forcible victims to understand another victim's perspective during a rape.

For the experiment, students prepare a solution of a series of homologous analytes and collect mass spectra of those analytes using GC-MS. All the analytes undergo the same three-step fragmentation in the mass spectrometer. The relative peak intensities from the ions in the fragmentation scheme are plotted as a function of the vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecular ions\u2019 R group. Trends in these plots can be explained using concepts from RRK theory and highlight the \u201cdegrees of freedom effect\u201d in mass spectrometry. The experiment is suitable for a variety of upper-level, undergraduate chemistry laboratories.\n",
