        "abstract": "RNA\u2010protein aggregates akin to membraneless organelles in modern biology offer a potential model for protocells and precursors to protocells in the chemistry of early Earth. In this project, we explore the aggregation properties of nucleic acids and their nucleotide monomers under a variety of conditions using a fluorescence dye\u2010based assay for aggregation. The building blocks of RNA \u2013 guanosine monophosphate and adenosine monophosphate showed intrinsic concentration\u2010dependent aggregation. Cyclic incubation between high and low temperatures, mimicking for example conditions around a hydrothermal vent, increased aggregation. This trend was enhanced when experiments were repeated with total RNA extracted from bacterial and fungal sources. RNA aggregation was further enhanced by the incorporation of peptides featuring an RNA binding sequence combined with an intrinsically disordered region. Our results show that RNA aggregation, a key first step on the pathway to protocells, can be enhanced through temperature cycling and the binding of short disordered peptides.\n",

        "abstract": "By 2050 there could be around 12 billion tons of plastic in landfills and the natural environment, which could be avoided by using a more environmentally friendly alternative: biologically produced plastic, or bioplastic. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a bioplastic whose precursor is an intermediate in the ethylmalonyl\u2010CoA pathway (EMCP), a pathway for acetyl\u2010CoA assimilation in bacteria. The genes that encode the enzymes for two different acetyl\u2010CoA assimilation pathways, the glyoxylate bypass (GB) and the EMCP, have been observed in two PHB\u2010producing bacteria:Rhodobacter capsulatusandParacoccus denitrificans. It was previously observed thatP. denitrificansasynchronously uses both pathways when grown with acetate. We producedR. capsulatusfusion strains by fusing the gene for a fluorescent protein, mCherry, to the gene of a key enzyme of the EMCP or GB and observed the fluorescence during growth with acetate. Tracking fluorescence allowed us to track the accumulation of each key enzyme, which indirectly indicates the activity of the pathway. We observed that unlikeP. denitrificans, the GB inR. capsulatusis not essential to growth with acetate. Understanding the use/occurrence of the EMCP in bacteria is a step to being able to manipulate the EMCP to produce commercially relevant levels of bioplastic and related products.\n",

        "abstract": "Honey bees are important for crop and wild flower pollination and are facing population decline due to several factors that may be mitigated through conservation efforts. The purpose of this study was to assess attitudes towards honey bees of adults visiting a honey bee information table at a University's weeklong pollinator event in the spring of 2019. Attitudes were assessed utilizing 12 statements scored on a 5-point Likert scale of strongly agree to strongly disagree. Relationships between demographics and attitudes were explored using chi-square test and Bonferroni correction. Attitudes towards honey bees were, overall, positive. Participants recognize the intelligence of honey bees and agree it is important to learn about honey bees, protect them, and that they are an important part of the environment. They disagreed that they felt fear when near a honey bee, and disagreed that it is better to kill a bee than be stung. Additionally, they disagreed that they would kill a honey bee found in their home. Participants strongly disagreed that honey bees are dangerous. Significant relationships were found between number of times a person was stung and attitudes towards learning about honey bees and whether a person felt that killing a honey bee is better than being stung. A significant relationship was also found between geographic location and importance of honey bees to the environment. This study highlighted the need to continue education and exposure of the public to honey bees in order to positively affect perceptions.\n",

Effect of an 11-week resistance training program on arterial stiffness in young women.J Strength Cond Res37(2): 315\u2013321, 2023\u2014The current investigation was conducted to determine the effect of 2 resistance training models on indices of arterial stiffness in young, healthy women. Twenty-four women, untrained college students, aged 18\u201322 years were randomized into 1 of 3 groups: control (CON) group (n= 8), high-intensity (HI) resistance exercise group (n= 8), and high-volume (HV) resistance exercise group (n= 8). Subjects randomized to resistance training groups were required to perform strength training exercises 3\u20135 days a week for 11 weeks. The exercise regimen consisted of 2\u20133 sets of 3\u20138 repetitions (80\u201390% of 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) for the HI group and 3\u20134 sets of 10\u201315 repetitions (50\u201370% of 1RM) for the HV group. All subjects were instructed to continue their normal diet and avoid cardiovascular exercise during the study. After the intervention, there was a significant increase in carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) (6.39 \u00b1 0.73 to 8.40 \u00b1 2.31 m\u00b7s\u22121;p< 0.05) and carotid radial PWV (9.77 \u00b1 1.74 to 12.58 \u00b1 2.09 m\u00b7s\u22121;p< 0.05) in the CON group alone. Both the HI and HV groups increased their maximum squat (36.6 \u00b1 7.9 vs. 41.3 \u00b1 31.8 percent change;p< 0.05), bench press (34.4 \u00b1 12.6 vs. 23.4 \u00b1 11.1 percent change;p< 0.05), and seated row (22.0 \u00b1 12.6 vs. 21.9 \u00b1 12.5 percent change;p< 0.05), respectively. Our findings support the use of resistance training exercise without undue impact on vascular compliance in otherwise healthy women.\n",

        "abstract": "Established social psychology literature shows that people demonstrate a systematic bias when estimating the proportion of others who hold their viewpoint on a range of issues; the majority regularly underestimates agreement, and the minority shows even greater error in overestimating agreement with their viewpoint. Applying this to climate change may help us better understand the determinants of public opinion on that issue. Across four studies, we found that people who believe climate change is happening (the majority) underestimate the percentage of other people who hold their view, whereas those who do not believe climate change is happening (the minority) greatly overestimate agreement with their view. We consistently found this pattern for other contemporary issues where there was a clear majority/minority distinction. Furthermore, greater certainty of one's position on climate change was related to greater and more accurate estimates of agreement among the majority, whereas low certainty was associated with estimates closer to 50%. Consistent with cognitive availability as a mechanism for these findings, exploratory analyses suggest that greater certainty of climate change happening is associated with a greater subjective knowledge and frequency of thinking and hearing about climate change, and talking about it with others. Finding the majority/minority pattern of consensus bias for climate change and other issues suggests that general approaches, such as providing accurate normative data and targeting efforts according to a population's belief certainty, may impact public sentiment and engagement on climate change.\n",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic forced many public health professionals to take on new roles such as online teaching, communicating, and managing; serving on the frontlines of patient care; and serving as health education resource personnel. Researchers of this study posed the question: How has the pandemic impacted those who serve to help others? Seven aspects of self-efficacy in professional practice were examined via an online survey sent to health educators. Respondents were extremely confident communicating with their colleagues and supervisors (60%) and with students (51%), but only 19% were extremely confident in maintaining a work-life balance and 22% in managing personal and professional stress. Respondents reported being confident in all areas of responsibilities, overall, but they were most confident in Area 8 (ethics and professionalism) and least confident in Area 1 (assessing the needs and capacity of a community) since COVID-19. Findings imply a need for more professional development opportunities to foster professional and personal self-efficacy and to improve self-efficacy in needs assessment, leadership, and advocacy. Findings also show a need for workplace or state-based interventions to support resiliency and self-care among professionals who work to serve others.\n",

        "abstract": "Youth-led participatory action research (YPAR) is an applied research methodology in which youth work in collaboration with adult stakeholders to conduct research projects. YPAR has been traditionally conducted in person, with virtual forums typically serving as ways to share resources and ideas across independent YPAR teams or collecting data. The COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the closure of most public spaces where youth congregate (including schools) and requirements to socially distance, led to translating YPAR projects into completely virtual formats. This paper aims to provide promises and challenges of conducting virtual YPAR during the COVID-19 pandemic. It describes how a team of university faculty, college students, and youth from two community-based youth organizations navigated a YPAR experience during the 2020-2021 academic year. We provide reflections on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on (a) the research setting, (b) the building of collaborative relationships, (c) YPAR methodology, (d) youth engagement, and (e) conceptualization of community action and engagement. We end with the implications for the future of YPAR for practitioners.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nAdvancing technology and increasing demand for contactless purchase methods have encouraged retailers to integrate technology into the point-of sale experience. However, limited research explores how consumers perceive contactless payment technology compared with traditional payment methods. Two experiments demonstrate that contactless payment methods, when compared with traditional, contact forms of payments such as cash and credit card transactions, are perceived as less contaminated. Additionally, consumers using contactless payment technology hold more favorable attitudes toward the retailer. However, the benefits derived from using contactless payments are negated for retailers whose customers expect to use contaminated methods of payment, such as cash.\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nWellness behaviors enacted during the college years may have long-term impacts on adult health; as such, it is critical that college students be educated regarding health behaviors and ways to improve their wellness. One way to educate students in reference to improved health practices is through college/university instructional physical activity programs that include a didactic wellness component. Limited research is available on the impact that courses of this nature have on student wellness outcomes. To assess the impact of a 15-week fitness and wellness course on perceived wellness in emerging adults, a convenience sample of undergraduate students (N = 334) enrolled in a general education Lifelong Fitness and Wellness class completed an instrument consisting of the Perceived Wellness Survey (PWS), the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-3), and demographic questions at the beginning and end of the Fall 2018 semester. Data were collected using a web-based survey administered through a password-protected Qualtrics account. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the goodness of fit of participants\u2019 responses on the PWS to the proposed model and then the data were analyzed using a pretest/posttest statistical design. Mixed analyses of covariance revealed improvements in overall wellness, emotional wellness, and physical wellness from pretest to posttest with no impact on lecture delivery mode or activity participation type. These results indicate that general wellness and fitness courses may positively impact perceived wellness in college students.\n\nKEYWORDS: Physical activity, wellness, young adults\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\n",

        "abstract": "The growing human population is responsible for a massive decline in species, biodiversity, and ecosystems across the globe. If we are to significantly slow these losses, the attention and resources devoted to individual causes should be commensurate with the magnitude of their contribution to the problem. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative magnitude of five major threats to species identified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as threatened with extinction. Specifically, we analyzed the entire IUCN Red List database to determine the percentage of threatened species affected by overexploitation, climate change, pollution, habitat destruction, and invasive species, diseases, and genes. We also randomly sampled a portion of the database to estimate the percentage of species for which each threat was the dominant threat placing them at risk of extinction. Of the 20,784 species for which data were available, 88.3% were impacted by habitat destruction, 26.6% by overexploitation, 25% by invasives, 18.2% by pollution, and 16.8% by climate change and weather. Focusing on dominant threats, the percentage of species for which a given threat was the main factor pushing them toward extinction was as follows: habitat destruction 71.3%, overexploitation 7.4%, invasives 6.8%, pollution 4.7%, climate change, and weather 1.8%. Regardless of how percentages are calculated, habitat destruction threatens more species than all other categories combined, climate change the fewest. From the perspective of species and biodiversity conservation, these data suggest that a significant change in global environmental priorities is needed. Habitat destruction should become a greater focus of global environmental efforts and receive the attention and resources appropriate to the extraordinary magnitude of its impact. Moreover, while it is important to address all environmental problems, given the disproportionate impact habitat destruction has on species, care should be taken to avoid solutions to other problems that exacerbate this destruction.\n",

        "abstract": "Due to systemic racialized homophobia and transphobia, Black lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer\u00a0(LGBTQ+) people continue to experience worse life outcomes in comparison to both their Black cisgender and heterosexual, and White LGBTQ+\u00a0counterparts. Community psychologists have the tools and training to address these disparities. Using a critical whiteness studies lens, we draw on qualitative data with 17 White LGBTQ+\u00a0people to describe how white supremacy manifests in LGBTQ+\u00a0spaces. Our research indicates White LGBTQ+\u00a0people want to create intersectional spaces but lack the necessary skills to effectively confront anti\u2010Black racism. This resulted in actions which upheld and reinforced white supremacy, despite stated commitments to Black LGBTQ+\u00a0liberation. We conclude with recommendations for community psychologists, including engaging in intersectional coalition\u2010building, training centered around queer critical race theory, working to address racialized homophobia and transphobia alongside existing efforts to deconstruct anti\u2010Black racism within community psychology, and consciousness\u2010raising work with White people involved in LGBTQ+\u00a0equality movements to dismantle white supremacist structures within their organizations.\n",

The dramatic decline of this species heightens the significance of new occurrences outside the known range. Herein we report the first ever capture and genetic confirmation of an adult male Northern Long-eared Bat on the Delmarva Peninsula, MD, located on the northern portion of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. This finding suggests further surveys are needed along the Atlantic Coastal Plain to determine if this region is being increasingly utilized by this species in the era of WNS.\n",

(Sponsor: Bert H.

Indeed, due to the global pandemic, physical activity has been reduced by 32.3% among previously active participants. Regular exercise is an effective way to maintain health and also results in various physiological adaptations in the neuromuscular and cardiovascular systems, which lead to improved physical performance.\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a functional training program, delivered via Zoom, on the neuromuscular system as well as resting blood pressure measures.\nMETHODS: Fifteen participants were assigned to either exercise (M = 4; F = 5) or control (M = 3; F = 3) group. The 4-week bodyweight circuit exercise protocol (i.e., jumping jacks; modified push-ups; high knees; squat; mountain climbers; and lunges) was performed 3d/wk for four weeks. Maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) were performed using a handgrip dynamometer. During each contraction, surface electromyography (sEMG) and force signals were recorded to assess sEMG amplitude (RMS) of flexor carpi radialis muscle as well as peak force (PF). Additionally, the brachial artery's resting blood pressure (BP) in a fasted state was recorded before and after the 4-week intervention. BP was self-monitored by participants once a day for 4 weeks to evaluate systolic and diastolic pressure readings. Two-way ANOVAs with factors of group [i.e., home-based exercise (HBE); control (CON)] and time [i.e., pre-post] were used to analyze pre- and post-testing measures.\nRESULTS: No significant (p > 0.05) differences between groups were observed in resting BP and sEMG-RMS. However, the HBE group significantly (p < 0.05) increased MVIC of the right hand (HBE: 27.8 \u00b1 5.1 to 31.2 \u00b1 5.2 kg, CON: 26.0 \u00b1 2.3 to 25.6 \u00b1 2.6 kg) from pre- to post-testing.\nCONCLUSION: Despite the lack of significant improvements in neural activation and resting blood pressure, the HBE groups significantly improved muscular strength by performing home-based functional circuit workouts. These findings suggest that home-based functional training delivered remotely is an effective strategy to improve muscular strength after four weeks.Copyright \u00a9 2022 by the American College of Sports MedicineView full article text\n",

Using overall capital productivity as an efficiency proxy and state output share as an inequality proxy, we identify the efficiency threshold of state capital share that splits the efficiency-equality relationship between a tradeoff and nontradeoff. When state capital share is greater than the threshold (as evidenced in the case of China), lowering state capital share improves efficiency and reduces inequality. Furthermore, our simulation results suggest that the threshold is sensitive to capital shares in output of the both sectors. A broad scope for mutual gains in efficiency and\u00a0equality exists by raising the capital share in nonstate output and lowering the capital share in state output.\n",

        "abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) results in degenerating peripheral nerves and affects over 50% of people with diabetes. Despite its high prevalence, DPN\u2019s molecular pathways remain unknown, limiting treatment to pain management. The Clark lab has characterized two novel models of hyperglycemia in zebrafish in which DPN\u2010like phenotypes are recapitulated, including demyelination. In an attempt to elucidate the unknown molecular mechanisms of DPN, candidate small molecule drugs are currently being tested to accentuate or attenuate neurodegeneration. Lavendustin\u2010A, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), was hypothesized to have a neuroprotective role, as overactivation of EGFR in hyperglycemic environments is associated with fibrosis and the inhibition of regeneration in various tissue types.Tg(mbp:gfpcaax)larval zebrafish were incubated in egg water (control 1) or 120mM glucose solution (control 2 and treatment) starting five days post\u2010fertilization (dpf) until 10dpf. From 10\u201012dpf, control 1 remained in egg water + 1% DMSO, control 2 remained in glucose solution + 1% DMSO, and the treatment group remained in glucose solution + 1% DMSO + 65.5\u00b5M Lavendustin\u2010A. 12dpf, lateral images of myelinated (MBP+) peripheral motor nerves were taken on an EVOS imaging system. Fiji (NIH) software was used to measure the length and fluorescent intensity of the myelinated nerves. Both nerve length (*p=0.025) and MBP fluorescent intensity (**p=0.0013) were significantly greater in the treatment group compared to the hyperglycemic fish (control 2), and no significant difference was observed between the treatment group and control 1. To determine if function was impacted, a touch\u2010response assay was conducted before (10dpf) and after (12dpf) drug treatment. Escape response was significantly impaired in hyperglycemic fish (treatment and control 2) at 10dpf (***p=0.0007) and significantly improved in the treatment group by 12dpf (***p=0.0003), yet did not fully recover, as there was still a significant difference between the treatment group and control 1 (**p=0.0017). Our data suggests a possible role of EGFR in hyperglycemia\u2010induced neurodegeneration, getting us one step closer to identifying potential therapeutics for clinical application.\n",

        "abstract": "How German were German anarchists in the United States and Brazil? Did the experience of exile and immigration preserve or even heighten a national identity among radicals who openly espoused revolutionary internationalism? Anarchists distinguished between nation and nationality on the one hand, and the state and nationalism on the other. This article examines expressions of nationality by a handful of German anarchist editors and writers from the 1880s to the end of World War II. They wanted to be stateless, but not nationless. This article argues that German exile anarchists in the United States and Brazil expressed a militant, countercultural, antistatist and anticlerical nationality. They were \u2018rooted cosmopolitans\u2019: They identified with the international revolutionary tradition and at the same time remained attached to Germany's heritage of radical politics, arts and humanities. There was a remarkable consistency in their commentary levelled against Bismarck, the Kaiser, the Weimar government and the Nazis either in Germany or in the host country. Anarchists advocated for a borderless global federation of free communities and, to that end, rejected nationalism and urged people to stop \u2018seeing like a state\u2019 by exposing the false promises and crimes of statism.\n",

When constructed to reflect best practices evidenced in the research literature, micro-credentials and other 21st century innovations provide accessible, meaningful, professional learning experiences for educators. This chapter discusses two cases that affected personal transformation and pedagogical change for in-service teachers by an institution of higher education (IHE). A preliminary analysis of these alternative experiences established that when teacher professional development is founded on the context-sensitive integration of social and cultural competencies, meaningful, empowering, and enduring learning can take place.\n",

In the Clark lab we have previously established a glucose immersion model of hyperglycemic induction in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). Zebrafish are a viable model to study diabetic complications as they glucoregulate similar to mammals and have robust regenerative abilities previously shown to regenerate pancreatic b\u2010cells, peripheral nerves, cardiac muscle, and fins. Given the negative impact diabetes has on bones, we hypothesized that hyperglycemia would negatively impact vertebral development; but given zebrafish\u2019s ability to regenerate we also hypothesized that after a recovery from hyperglycemia, the vertebrae would have a similar phenotype to controls. Larval zebrafish were incubated in 120 mM glucose solution (treatment), or egg water (control), for seven days beginning five days post fertilization (dpf). To assess vertebral development following a recovery period, zebrafish were placed in normal egg water for an additional ten days, and control fish were kept in egg water for an equal amount of time. Using alizarin red to visualize mineralized vertebrae after 7\u2010day incubation in glucose solution (12dpf) showed a reduced percentage of zebrafish with any mineralized vertebrae compared to controls (****p<0.0001). The vertebrae that were present following treatment had significantly less area of mineralized centra compared to controls (****p<0.0001). This suggests that hyperglycemia negatively impacted initial vertebral development. Following recovery (22 dpf), the treatment fish had significantly reduced total body length than controls (****p<0.0001). Treatment fish continued to have significantly less mineralized centra area (****p<0.0001) and significantly increased area of intervertebral domain (****p<0.0001) when compared to size matched controls. This suggests that the vertebrae of treatment fish are mineralizing and expanding into the intervertebral domain at a slower rate than controls. Additionally, glucose\u2010treated fish had significantly reduced percentage of fish with mineralized neural (****p<0.0001) and hemal (****p<0.0001) arches present on their vertebra compared to controls. These results suggest a dramatic impairment of vertebral development that extends beyond both treatment and recovery periods, leading us to believe the reduced mineralization may be responsible for the behavioral deficits through reductions in their ability to swim. Furthermore, our results may indicate profound effects of gestation and childhood diabetes on the skeletal development of children. Future experiments will investigate osteoblast and chondrocyte populations following hyperglycemic induction and recovery to elucidate the mechanisms that result in impaired vertebral mineralization. This discovery would guide further research into potential therapeutics for diabetes\u2010induced osteoporosis.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTAs of 2018, there were more than 44.7 million immigrants residing, both lawfully and unlawfully, in the United States [Batalova, J., Blizzard, B., & Bolter, J. (2020, February 14). Frequently requested statistics on immigrants and immigration in the United States. Migration Policy Institute. https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states]. Understanding the attitudes of U.S. citizens towards immigrants is necessary because of the impact that attitudes can have on policy development and the subsequent national treatment of immigrants based on those policies. This article utilizes a framework of national identity which suggests that this construct is comprised of three separate elements: nativism, emotionality, and behavior. Using U.S. citizen response data from three waves of the National Identity module of the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) from 1995, 2003, and 2013, multivariate linear regressions were used to explore the relationship between this framework and attitudes towards immigrants. Findings indicated that there were statistically significant relationships between respondents\u2019 perceptions of national identity and attitudes towards immigrants.KEYWORDS: National identityimmigration attitudesimmigration policynativismbehavioremotionalityDisclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Additional informationNotes on contributorsAmanda HillDr. Amanda Hill earned her master\u2019s degree in social work from Salisbury University in 2010, and her PhD in social work from Widener University in 2019.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThe intersection of ethics and diversity is central to our profession\u2014yet it remains critically unexamined. This article seeks to fill this gap by suggesting the use of a new ethical deliberation heuristic: intersectional ethics. Grounded in intersectionality as a social theory and anti-oppressive practice, intersectional ethics utilizes six heuristic questions to consider positionality, social identity categories, dominant and non-dominant moral theories, professional mandates, and power. These questions are incremental and cumulative in nature; they are meant to engage and support anti-oppressive ethics, and to promote critical inquiry and reflexivity. Specific recommendations\u2014including modules\u2014are made for integrating the heuristic in social work ethics curriculum.\n\nKEYWORDS: Ethics, diversity, intersectionality, anti-oppressive, reflexivity\n\nAcknowledgment\nThe author wishes to thank Anthony A. Bibus, Professor Emeritus, Augsburg University, Department of Social Work, for his helpful review of the initial manuscript. The author also wishes to thank the reviewers for their helpful feedback.\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nAdditional information\nNotes on contributors\nBibiana D.

This study analyzes candidate announcements from the 2020 Democratic Party nomination for president and how each of the top six candidates branded themselves. The campaign announcement is the first opportunity to shape the brand of the candidate in a crowded field of candidates. Comparisons will be made between candidates with national name recognition and those who have yet to make a name for themselves on a national stage. For more well-known candidates, this address is meant to energize supporters and build momentum toward the nomination. Well-known candidates may be able to more clearly form a branding around policy positions. For the lesser-known candidates, it is a chance to introduce themselves to the nation and begin to build a following. These speakers may present a more personal narrative to brand themselves as an individual before presenting policy. A comparison will also be made between male and female candidates, including an analysis of gendered language in announcing their candidacy.\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article presents some features, potentials, limitations, and bibliographies of the intersection of postcolonialism, postsecularism, and literary studies. It examines literatures, cultures, religions, indigenous beliefs and practices, and political imaginaries from Africa, Europe, and South Asia. The religions discussed include Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism. The article shows how the institutional and discursive emergence of postcolonial postsecularism, including its intersection with literary studies, can draw lessons from similarly contestatory fields of study, such as postcolonial theory, postcolonial feminism, and intersectional feminism. The article includes bibliographies of literary works that address secularism and postsecularism, including their intersection with postcoloniality. KEYWORDS: Postcolonial postsecularism, intersectional feminism, literary studies, Europe, Africa, South Asia.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTCurrently, there is renewed interest in organizations providing greater economic benefits to its members given the widening divide among social classes. A major source of alternatives to capitalist organizations in the U.S. was the co-operative movement sponsored by the Knights of Labor during 1870\u20131889. This study examines cases of the Knights\u2019 producer cooperatives to understand how they functioned and why they failed. The intent of the co-operatives was to restore worker independence and control over their work in the emerging factory system. This study applies core frames of social movements to examine the motivation and processes the Knights used to establish their cooperatives. Micro histories of selected co-ops in three regions of the U.S. were developed from primary research conducted during the 1880s as well as contemporary journals and newspapers. Rather than being radical, the co-operatives were based on American republican ideals, and they borrowed governance structures similar to corporations, both of which contributed to their success. Reasons for the failure of the Knights and their co-ops are examined. The legacy of the Knights\u2019 producer co-ops is discussed along with ideas for future research.\n\nKEYWORDS: Co-operatives, Knights of Labor, labor republicanism, micro histories, social movement analysis\n\nDisclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nCorrection Statement This article has been corrected with minor changes. These changes do not impact the academic content of the article.\n\nNotes 1. The nineteenth century hyphenated spelling of \u2018co-operative\u2019 is used throughout the paper. 2. Early non-labor co-operatives included communities of Robert Owen\u2019s co-operative community in the 1820s and Charles Fourier\u2019s Associationists in the 1840s; see, Wright (Citation2010). 3. The Knights backed Greenback Party sought monetary reform during a recession, but it faded with an upturn in the economy in 1879\u201382, see Curl (2012, pp. 89\u201390). 4. In the 1880s John Bates Clark, an economist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore was interested in the growth of organizations using employee ownership and profit sharing. He divided up the country into five regions and assigned a doctoral student to study the development of these firms in each region. The five researchers (i.e. Edward Bemis, Albert Shaw, Amos Warner, Howard Shinn, and Daniel Randall) conducted onsite visits and interviews with many co-ops in their assigned regions. These studies formed the basis of their dissertations and were eventually published as the History of Co-operation in the United States (1888) which represented Vol. VI in the Johns Hopkins Studies in Historical and Political Science edited by Herbert B. Adams. 5. According to Curl (2012, pp. 88\u201391), by 1872 two-thirds of the employed were estimated to be wage earners. 6. For example, both the National Labor Union and the International Working People\u2019s Association referred to or quoted the Declaration of Independence (Powderly, Citation1889, pp. 81\u201382). 7. The KoL\u2019s first assemblies included sojourners, shipwrights, weavers, and riggers. 8. The great upheaval that resulted in over 100 strikers killed, over 500 wounded and more than 1000 jailed. Hayes use of troops to quell labor unrest was the first such presidential action in the U.S. 9. Powderly had been elected mayor of Scranton, PA, a mining and railroad center, under the Greenback Labor Party; once the party failed, Powderly became disillusioned with a political solution (Dubofsky & McCartin, 2017). 10. Prior to his KoL work, Sharpe had founded a co-operative community in Missouri and in 1884 became the editor of the Co-operative section of the Journal of United Labor. 11. Another poll taken at the General Assembly in 1884 revealed that only 14 members were in favor of a compulsory fee or tax to fund co-ops; thereafter it was left up to local assemblies. 12. In the face of bad harvests and depression, the French King was overthrown, and the Second Republic was established under Louis Napoleon III after a brief worker rebellion in Paris. It established the right to work among other things in France (see Agulhon, Citation1983). 13. Corporations had boards made up of both managers and outside members. The board hired the president who in turn hired other top managers who need not come from within the firm; it was not democratic like the co-ops. Furthermore, shares were sold to outsiders, and votes were based on shares held. Reports to shareholders were provided from one to four times a year. For more on corporate governance of the period see, see for example, Hilt (Citation2015). 14. Massachusetts co-op laws were amended in 1870 and 1879. 15. This proportional share of profits was modeled after the Rochdale distributive co-ops who distributed profits based on value of members\u2019 purchases. This became a common practice in many KoL producer co-ops. 16. In 1869, forty-five artisan coopers were able to make all the oak and elm barrels needed by the flour mills. By the 1870s, the mills produced 10\u201320 long rail trains of product every 24 hours, hence, the growth in cooper co-ops. 17. The article went onto say that co-ops were most successful in New York, the West, and the South but not in New England. 18. During the final decade of the century, the Sherman Act was used to break at least a dozen unions, but not once to break a corporate trust. 19. The use of federally protected Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) developed as part of the Employment Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 made union buyouts feasible, see for example, \u2018New York Times\u2019 (Citation2003).

        "abstract": "Corporations, which in the past have been hesitant to contribute to conversations regarding political and social issues, are increasingly speaking out on current issues such as race, sexual orientation, gender, immigration, and environmental issues. Despite this trend, limited academic research has focused on how corporate sociopolitical activism (CSA) efforts impact firm value. In addition, extant studies have not fully identified the extent to which the firm and their message influence the outcomes of this approach. The current study explores how sociopolitical stances communicated on Twitter affect firms\u2019 stock prices. Results from an event study of 260 incidents of CSA show that CSA efforts decrease firm value by an average of 0.22%, indicating that wading into social or political issues is a risky strategy. However, further analysis highlights the importance of clearly articulating stances on social issues that align with the firm\u2019s core values.\n",

        "abstract": "Females of many species choose mates using multiple sensory modalities. Multimodal noise may arise, however, in dense aggregations of animals communicating via multiple sensory modalities. Some evidence suggests multimodal signals may not always improve receiver decision-making performance. When sensory systems process input from multimodal signal sources, multimodal noise may arise and potentially complicate decision-making due to the demands on cognitive integration tasks. We tested female t\u00fangara frog, Physalaemus (=Engystomops) pustulosus, responses to male mating signals in noise from multiple sensory modalities (acoustic and visual). Noise treatments were partitioned into three categories: acoustic, visual, and multimodal. We used natural calls from conspecifics and heterospecifics for acoustic noise. Robotic frogs were employed as either visual signal components (synchronous vocal sac inflation with call) or visual noise (asynchronous vocal sac inflation with call). Females expressed a preference for the typically more attractive call in the presence of unimodal noise. However, during multimodal signal and noise treatments (robofrogs employed with background noise), females failed to express a preference for the typically attractive call in the presence of conspecific chorus noise. We found that social context and temporal synchrony of multimodal signaling components are important for multimodal communication. Our results demonstrate that multimodal signals have the potential to increase the complexity of the sensory scene and reduce the efficacy of female decision making.\n",

        "abstract": "Amphibious fishes have many adaptations that make them successful in a wide variety of conditions, including air-breathing, terrestrial locomotor capabilities, and extreme tolerance of poor water quality. However, the traits that make them highly adaptable may allow these fishes to successfully establish themselves outside of their native regions. In particular, the terrestrial capabilities of invasive amphibious fishes allow them to disperse overland, unlike fully aquatic invasive fishes, making their management more complicated. Despite numerous amphibious fish introductions around the world, ecological risk assessments and management plans often fail to adequately account for their terrestrial behaviors. In this review, I discuss the diversity of invasive amphibious fishes and what we currently know about why they emerge onto land, how they move around terrestrial environments, and how they orient while on land. In doing so, I use case studies of the performance and motivations of nonnative amphibious fishes in terrestrial environments to propose management solutions that factor in their complete natural history. Amphibious fish species have established a disproportionate number of nonative populations globally compared to fully aquatic species. Because of their terrestrial capabilities, we may need to manage amphibious fishes more like amphibians than fully aquatic fishes, but to do so, we need to learn more about how these species perform in a wide range of terrestrial environments and conditions.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education (JSDSE) has a history of initiatives to expand its readership and impact. In this article, we reflect on JSDSE\u2019s relevance to K-12 education and how it might increase its influence in this area. We characterize JSDSE\u2019s K-12 impact partially in terms of its ability to foster statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT). We also introduce a new construct, statistical knowledge for the transformation of teaching (SKT2), to more fully capture the K-12 contributions JSDSE can make. Our analysis draws upon the perspectives of an experienced high school teacher (the first author) and a statistics education researcher (the second author). The first author of the article surveyed recent JSDSE issues to identify and reflect upon articles with implications for his teaching practice. The second author framed the first author\u2019s article reflections in terms of their connections to SKT and SKT2. Drawing upon our collaborative analysis, we propose strategies to help JSDSE more fully realize its potential to contribute to SKT and SKT2. We explain how acting on the proposed strategies may help JSDSE readers, authors, and editors bridge the persistent historical gap between formal scholarship and practice in K-12 education.\n\nKEYWORDS: Assessment, Curriculum, Education, Pedagogical content knowledge, Professional development, Statistical knowledge for teaching\n\n1  Introduction\nThe Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education (JSDSE) has a long history of making scholarly work accessible to a wide audience. As the journal was founded, Arnold (Citation1993) stated that it was \u201cintended to be international in scope, dedicated to improving all postsecondary statistics education, and crossing both disciplinary and national borders\u201d (n. p.). The intended audience encompassed those teaching \u201cpure\u201d statistics as well as those teaching statistics in various disciplines such as psychology, economics, and biology.\n\nAs the journal grew, efforts to expand its reach grew as well. For example, in 2007, a new department, \u201cFrom Research to Practice,\u201d was established to encourage conversations about using research to inform teaching. The journal\u2019s readers were invited to craft submissions by \u201cfinding a research article of interest, reading and reflecting on it, implementing ideas from the paper in their classes, assessing the results, writing up their findings, and submitting it\u201d (Miller Citation2007, n. p.). Another new department, \u201cResearch on K-12 Statistics Education,\u201d was later established to encourage study of precollege teaching and learning of statistics (Jacobbe Citation2013). Although the journal\u2019s original intended audience was those teaching college-level statistics, it has expanded to include K-12 issues. The journal\u2019s efforts to expand its K-12 content and connect research to practice, along with the fact that it is freely available online, make it a potentially powerful catalyst to help improve K-12 teaching and learning.\n\n2  Purpose\nIn this article, we aim to support JSDSE\u2019s goal of improving K-12 statistics education by reflecting on the journal\u2019s current and potential impact in this area. Our reflections draw upon our backgrounds in K-12 education and statistics education research. The first author of this article is a high school teacher. When the article was written, he had 7 years of teaching experience at a rural high school of approximately 500\u2013600 students and had taught AP Statistics each year to classes ranging between 10 and 25 students in size. He also had served as an official AP Statistics exam scorer. The second author is a university faculty member and researcher in the field of statistics education. He has investigated the nature and importance of statistical knowledge for teaching and has published such work in JSDSE and in other venues. Collectively, our reflections highlight directions JSDSE has taken, and may be able to take in the future, to publish content addressing the needs of K-12 statistics teachers.\n\n3  Method\nA reading response journal (Lee Citation2008) constructed during a 5-week independent study course provided the initial collaboration space for the reflections reported in this article. The second author, who served as course instructor, elicited the first author\u2019s initial impressions of JSDSE by asking him to browse recent volumes of the journal and select articles with relevance to his teaching practice. Each week, the first author selected three articles from a volume of JSDSE published within the past five years, initially attending to articles with value for teaching AP Statistics. As the first author carried out this task, he wrote reflections on how each selected article could inform his practice and uploaded the reflections to an online course management system. The second author then wrote detailed feedback on the first author\u2019s journal entries to prompt additional reflection on implications for statistics education. Providing such feedback on written journal entries can be a powerful technique to foster and deepen reflection (Pieper et al. Citation2021). At the end of each week of the course, the two authors met to discuss the reflections and feedback. These discussions helped identify additional possible implications for teaching AP Statistics and K-12 education in general. A subjectively chosen sample of 15 articles was discussed using this process.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nPre-adolescent transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) youth who are supported by their parents have improved psychosocial outcomes. Despite the important role parents play in TGNC youth\u2019s development, there is little research on their experiences. This study explored the early parenting experiences of 34 parents of pre-adolescent TGNC youth. Parents were recruited from online communities and listservs, and interviewed via phone about their early parenting experiences. Data were analyzed via thematic analysis. Findings indicate that parents became aware of their child\u2019s TGNC identity either through observing their child\u2019s gender behaviors, or by their child verbalizing their identity. Parents, on average, became aware of their child\u2019s gender identity exploration when they were just over 3 and a half years old. Parents felt a mix of emotions, with many reporting a lack of concern or positive emotions regarding their child\u2019s rejection of traditional gender roles. Parents without prior knowledge of transgender people or existing connections to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ+) people sought out information from the Internet. The findings are both consistent with and diverge from prior research with parents, suggesting both new areas for research, and additional ways in which TGNC youth and their parents can be best supported.\n\nKeywords: Transgender, children, parenting, gender identity\n\nAcknowledgements\nThank you to the participants who were willing to share their stories with us, to Abbey Hamburg, Claire Howard, Audriana Holstein, Alexis Pritchard, Deija Spencer, Juliet Vaspva, and Celeste Welsh for their assistance on this project, and to the anonymous reviewers who provided feedback on prior versions of this manuscript.\n\nDisclosure statement\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n\nFunding\nNotes\n1 The term \u201cTGNC\u201d is used for both consistency with prior literature and with the interview questions used in this project. However, other gender identities, including but not limited to gender expansive, nonbinary, and agender identities are included under this term.\n2 Not all transgender adults identified as transgender in childhood, and not all transgender adults engaged in gender atypical behaviors as children.\n3 One interview was removed from analyses as the interview contained inconsistencies and was vague, which taken together implied that some or all of the data were either inaccurate or fabricated.\n\nAdditional information\nFunding: This work was supported by a Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues Grant-in-Aid awarded to the first author.\n",

        "abstract": "This study examined how firms combine alliances and acquisitions in an exploration/exploitation framework. By conducting cluster analysis on a sample of 1270 acquisitions made by 836 firms, we first identified the patterns in alliance and acquisition activities undertaken by these firms. Five distinct patterns were identified: (I) low alliance\u2013low acquisition, (II) low alliance\u2013high acquisition, (III) high alliance\u2013low acquisition, (IV) high alliance\u2013high acquisition, and (V) medium alliance\u2013very high acquisition. Next, we analyzed the different ways in which the two modes were interlinked within these five patterns for exploration/exploitation. Patterns III and IV appeared to involve both exploration/exploitation and mutually reinforce exploration/exploitation. In contrast, in the remaining patterns, the two modes appeared to be more loosely coupled with each other, with a focus on exploitation.\n",

        "abstract": "As societies become more concerned with environmental protection, some firms go beyond their legal obligations and proactively adopt their own green management practices even if those practices cannot produce short-term benefits. As a result, researchers have begun to question the underlying motives of these firms. Leveraging corporate loss aversion, we argue that firms that outperform their peers become more risk-seeking to avoid any future loss of competitive advantage. As a result, they become more likely to engage in stakeholder management in the form of green management practices. Specifically, we explore the Green Power Partnership (GPP) which solicits firms to purchase green power. Using the data for the green power consumed by firms that are participating in the GPP program in the United States, we find that firms with performance above social aspiration are likely to increase their use of green power. We also find that related diversification has a negative influence on such motivation.\n",

Yet, the lower status traditionally accorded to practitioner research, along with an absence of clear guidelines for its methodology and quality, challenge its acceptance as a form of knowledge production. The current study analyzes 74 accounts of practitioner research in literacy for evidence of methodological quality. Findings reveal ways practitioner researchers systematically conduct and report their inquiries as well as areas for improvement. The hallmarks of quality identified in this study can be used to advance practitioner research as a methodology and knowledge generating endeavor.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nIn this article we analyze the landscape of dance teacher certification programs in the United States for the potential of anti-racist transformation in the field of dance education. We look at higher educational programming as a main place for revolutionary change in the future of dance education because the socio-political culture within curricula, pedagogies, policies, and practices of dance education in higher education maps to that of P-12 educational settings. This article enlists the aid of the work of Tema Okun and adrienne maree brown to envision the re-culturing of dance teacher certification programs through somatic social justice and Emergent Strategy. The article includes somatic reflective practices for the readers to engage in throughout the article to provide a lived, enacted experience of the long-term, sustainable change we propose for the future of dance education.\n\nKEYWORDS: White supremacy culture, dance teacher certification, somatic social justice, dance education, Emergent Strategy\n\nDisclosure Statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\n\nNotes\n1. Channing Brown (Citation2018) writes of her lived experience as a Black woman navigating her existence within organizations that have no understanding that they operate from Whiteness, and the exhaustive emotional labor of trying to make visible the daily problematic actions that result. This (in)visibility means that her needs and racist experiences with the foundational Whiteness of the organizations, visible to her, are invisible to those she works with.\n2. According to generative somatics practitioner Sumitra Rajkumar, somatics is a methodology that is fundamentally relational and political. It understands that unjust power dynamics inherent in our societies, cultures, and experiential perspectives shape us in deep, embodied ways (Werning Citation2018; McZeal Citation2021). Somatic social justice practices collective embodied healing for justly transforming society (Thom Citation2020).\n3. White silence occurs 'when people with white privilege stay complicitly silent when it comes to issues of race' (Saad Citation2020, 230). An impact of silencing is 'a defending of the status quo of white supremacy' (Saad Citation2020, 54) and a betrayal of the work toward liberation. Silencing can operate on an individual level, such as a dance professor not addressing racial harm in the studio or racism as a structural oppression in dance in their syllabus. It can also operate in group dynamics or systems, such as a dance department\u2019s enacted policies or certification programming curriculum.\n4. https://docs.ccsu.edu/curriculumsheets/DanceEdBS_CurriculumSheet.pdf.\n5. https://catalog.usm.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=24&poid=11,297.\n6. https://manoa.Hawaii.edu/liveonstage/dance/dance-programoverview/.\n7. https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/catalog/Current/CollegesDepartments/ls-intro/thtda.aspx?DeptTab=Courses.\n8. https://www.whitesupremacyculture.info/characteristics.html.\n9. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XR_7M_9qa64zZ00_JyFVTAjmjVU-uSz8/view.\n\nChanning Brown, Austin. 2018.

One of the effects of this liberation of language upon Miller\u2019s play is the incorporation into Salesman of plays on words that contribute substantially to the motifs and themes of the play. In this regard, \u201cWord/Play\u201d contributes to the ongoing interest in the careful and imaginative use of language in Salesman, which was neglected for so many years, by exploring comprehensively Miller\u2019s use of wordplay, essentially arguing that he employs the device to such an extent that recognizing its presence provides an additional key to the understanding of the play\u2019s many rich meanings.\n",

        "abstract": "Combat veterans in contemporary cinema are often silent. It\u2019s not just that they rarely speak about the war; they typically have less dialogue overall than other characters, even as they appear in many scenes of the film and are often at the center of it. For Bartle, the protagonist of *The Yellow Birds* (Alexandre Moors, 2017), based on a novel of the same name by Kevin Powers (2012), silence is a survival tool during training; early on, for instance, he urges Murph, who will eventually become his best friend, to be quiet lest their sergeant hear them talking while they\u2019re loading clips on the firing range. Silence for the post-war Bartle, however, is different, bound up not just with the combat he takes part in, but also with guilt, both for Murph\u2019s death and for a war crime that the film gradually reveals. And while not every contemporary film about returning veterans has a war crime at its center\u2014many such films, in fact, emphasize the veteran\u2019s heroism\u2014almost all cinematic combat veterans begin the film in silence.\nThis silence is but the first step in a remarkably consistent generic arc: the cinematic veteran, returned to the United States, is characterized by silence; the narrative works toward a moment, either positioned as the climax or very nearly there, where the veteran tells their story; the story is told to a listener who often directly elicits the story; and once this story is told, the narrative implies a healing of wounds, with a promise of the veteran rejoining the community, often through the listener. (The consequences of not telling the story result in a different outcome, as we will see.) This arc is also one that we find in cinematic veterans on screen in earlier eras; Keith Beattie, whose work I discuss at greater length below, has traced out the Vietnam Veteran\u2019s movement from silence to speech in narrative representation. But whereas for Beattie\u2019s Vietnam Veteran, that transformation took years, the contemporary arc takes a mere two hours, and it occurs every time we view the films. And even if this was true for some earlier films as well, the consistency of the contemporary arc within a feature-film time-frame bears scrutiny here.\nThis essay will trace out this arc, and explore each stage of it, within a single film: *The Yellow Birds*. By examining *The Yellow Birds*, my hope is that it might bring us a bit closer to understanding the stories we are telling ourselves about military veterans returning from contemporary U.S. wars. In doing so, I hope to begin shedding light on the ways we view those veterans, the ways we view those wars, and the truth and lies we tell ourselves about both.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Evidence suggests that cash transfers through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) programme induce better birth outcomes. We use US Vital Statistics data for all births in Maryland from 1995\u20132004 to capture the casual effects of implementing a local EITC programme across households. Alternative difference-in-differences (DD) comparison groups compare treatment households with like households in non-EITC counties and ineligible households in the same county. We find that the implementation of the local EITC reduced the probability of low birth weight by as much as 3.5 percentage points for births to White and Black mothers with little evidence of an effect for Hispanic mothers. This reduction represents a 46% decrease for White mothers and 26% decrease for Black mothers. Despite improving average birth outcomes, EITC cash transfers did not reduce disparities in birth outcomes.

We are unable to determine when state EITC checks are mailed to recipients, but we are unaware of a systematic mailing date for these state checks.\n",

        "abstract": "Stimulation in one sensory modality can affect perception in a separate modality, resulting in diverse effects including illusions in humans. This can also result in cross-modal facilitation, a process where sensory performance in one modality is improved by stimulation in another modality. For instance, a simple sound can improve performance in a visual task in both humans and cats. However, the range of contexts and underlying mechanisms that evoke such facilitation effects remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated cross-modal stimulation in wild-caught t\u00fangara frogs, a species with well-studied acoustic preferences in females. We first identified that a combined visual and seismic cue (vocal sac movement and water ripple) was behaviourally relevant for females choosing between two courtship calls in a phonotaxis assay. We then found that this combined cross-modal stimulus rescued a species-typical acoustic preference in the presence of background noise that otherwise abolished the preference. These results highlight how cross-modal stimulation can prime attention in receivers to improve performance during decision-making. With this, we provide the foundation for future work uncovering the processes and conditions that promote cross-modal facilitation effects.\n",

        "abstract": "Sexual minority people in the United States are less likely to have access to health services when compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Less is known about the within-group sociodemographic memberships among sexual minority people regarding access to health services. Using data from a nationally representative sample, a series of univariate and bivariate analyses were used to determine associations between sociodemographic group membership and access to health services. Results suggest there are significant differences in access to health services within the sexual minority population. Differences in access to health services when considering sex-at-birth, sexual identity, age, race/ethnicity, urbanicity, education level and income status were found. These findings offer insight into the role sociodemographic group membership has on the equity of access to health services. Specifically, results indicated that disproportionate access to health services among sexual minority people were more pronounced among those with group membership who experience social marginalisation. This was particularly true for sexual minority people who were bisexual, younger, Black and Latinx, lower-income earners and sexual minority people with less education attainment. Results from this study may be used to inform policies and practices aimed at improving access to health services including, but not limited to, the expansion of the Affordable Care Act and continued development of Federally Qualified Health Centers, while acknowledging the role of within-group differences among sexual minority people.\n\n### What is known about this topic\nSexual minority people report less access to health services when compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Some differences in access to health services within the sexual minority population have been documented.\n\n### What this paper adds\nThis paper reports differences in access to health services among sexual minority people living in the United States using a nationally representative sample. Findings suggest there are differences in access to health services within the sexual minority population when considering sex-at-birth, sexual identity, age, race/ethnicity, urbanicity, education level and income status.\n\n1 BACKGROUND\nSexual minority people, which includes those who identify as non-heterosexual, systematically report less access to health services when compared to heterosexual people (Albuquerque et al., 2016; Buchmueller & Carpenter, 2010; Heck et al., 2006; Luk et al., 2017). Sexual minority people are a large and diverse group of people who experience significant physical health disparities (Blosnich et al., 2014; Dahlhamer et al., 2016; Hafeez et al., 2017). In particular, sexual minority people are disproportionately diagnosed with HIV (Operario et al., 2015; P\u00e9rez et al., 2018), sexually transmitted infections (Hafeez et al., 2017; Operario et al., 2015), cancer (Quinn et al., 2015), and diabetes (Liu et al., 2019). These health outcomes are often preventable or highly treatable with consistent and time-appropriate access to health services (Shi, 2012). Access to health services is an effective strategy for addressing health disparities among marginalised groups of people (Derose et al., 2011; Healthy People, 2020; Institute of Medicine, 1993). Access to health services includes, but is not limited to, having a usual place of care to receive primary care services and receiving culturally appropriate services, as well as having health insurance coverage (Carmody, 2007; Healthy People, 2020; Institute of Medicine, 1993). Access to health insurance is associated with timely health service use and a reduction of chronic health conditions (Institute of Medicine, 1993; Lyon et al., 2014). A usual place of care to receive primary care services (which does not include emergency or hospital in-patient services) helps gain access to timely medical treatment or preventative health services (Devoe et al., 2008; Shi, 2012), while culturally appropriate health services address the experiences and concerns unique to specific populations (Healthy People, 2020). Sexual minority people are less likely to have health insurance coverage (Silvers, 2013; Skopec & Long, 2015) and are more likely to have trouble locating available health services (Dahlhamer et al., 2016). For example, Dahlhamer and colleagues found that gay men had greater difficulty finding a healthcare provider (8.5% vs. 4.2%) and a greater percentage of gay/lesbian women did not have a usual source of care (24.4% vs. 14.5%). Indeed, other work also indicates that sexual minority people are less likely to have a primary care service provider (Ward et al., 2014) and to delay seeking health services including when there is a need for health service use (Clift & Kirby, 2012; Jennings et al., 2019). Sexual minority people also experience barriers in accessing culturally appropriate health services (Johnson, 2017; Jowett & Peel, 2009) in the general medical community that consider their specific sexuality-related needs within an affirming, respectful and safe environment (Felsenstein, 2018). Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) health centres may offer sexual minority people a more culturally appropriate place to receive their health care as these services specialise in the medical treatment for this population (Martos et al., 2017), although the use of these services among sexual minority people is relatively unexplored. Health access disparities observed among sexual minority people may be rooted in heterosexism (Clift & Kirby, 2012; Green & Mirizio-Wheeler, 2019; Kerker et al., 2006; Underhill et al., 2015). Heterosexism is a systemic form of social marginalisation that subjects sexual minority people to various forms of discrimination and prejudice because of their non-heterosexual identities, attractions or behaviours (Herek, 1996). This is in accord with the Minority Stress Theory (Meyer, 2003), which posits that sexual minority people experience, anticipate and internalise discrimination because of their sexual minority identity. Sexual minority people may experience or anticipate physicians' refusal to treat sexual minority patients or mistreatment by medical staff which influences access to health care and the development of chronic health conditions (Frost et al., 2015; Green & Mirizio-Wheeler, 2019; Lick et al., 2013). Although differences in access to health services among sexual minority people compared to heterosexual people are well documented, less is known about the within-group sociodemographic group membership differences for sexual minority people regarding access to health services. In line with an intersectional approach, sexual minority people are members of varying sociodemographic group membership identities including various racial/ethnic backgrounds, ages, sex, socio-economic statuses, geographic locations and education (Ng, 2016; Parent et al., 2013). The sociodemographic group membership of sexual minority people within the sexual minority community is associated with disproportioned health outcomes not otherwise captured when looking exclusively at differences between sexual minority people and heterosexual people (Hafeez et al., 2017). For example, one recent study found that Black and Latinx older sexual minority people reported lower quality of physical health when compared to their White counterparts (Kim et al., 2017), while another study found Black sexual minority women were more likely to have a history of diabetes and hypertension, as well as lower physical activity and higher body mass index compared to White sexual minority women (Molina et al., 2014). Another study suggested bisexual older adults were more likely to live at or close to the poverty level (Fredriksen-Goldsen, Emlet, et al., 2013; Fredriksen-Goldsen, Kim, et al., 2013), which may impact health outcomes. Limited empirical evidence suggests differences in access to health services may exist between groups of sexual minority people by sociodemographic group membership. Older sexual minority people report engaging in healthcare services less often than younger sexual minority people (Green et al., 2018). Racial/ethnic minority sexual minority people have lower rates of health insurance coverage (Macapagal et al., 2016), while gay/lesbian females are more likely to have a usual source of care compared to bisexual females (Pharr et al., 2019). Yet, less is known about where health disparities exist in health insurance coverage, having a primary care service provider, and using culturally appropriate services in the form of LGBT-health services within diverse groups of sexual minority people. Thus, the goal of the current study was to examine sociodemographic group membership differences in access to health services within a national sample of sexual minority people. Examining these differences may further efforts to address sexual minority health disparities by highlighting the need for interventions aiming for health equity through improvement in access to health services.\n\n2 METHODS\n\n2.1 Study background\nData were used from the Generations study at wave 1. The Generations study was reviewed and approved by Gallup, Inc. and the University of California, Los Angeles, University of California, San Francisco, University of California, Santa Cruz, University of Texas at Austin, and University College London institutional review boards. The University of Southern California Institutional Review Board approved the current study.\n\n2.2 Recruitment\nParticipants for the Generations study (wave 1) were recruited by Gallup, Inc., a survey research consulting company, using the Gallup Daily Tracking Survey for initial contact. The tracking survey is a telephone interview of a national probability sample that collects data from ~1000 adults per day for 350 days about politics, economics and overall personal well-being. Respondents were eligible if they identified as lesbian, gay or bisexual, spoke English well enough to conduct a phone interview; and 18 or older and within two years of the study's target age cohort ages (cohort target ages: Cohort 1: 18\u201327 years; Cohort 2: 32\u201343 years; Cohort 3: 52\u201361). Eligibility criteria also included having an education level of sixth grade or above and self-identified as Black, Latinx or White. Eligible participants were contacted and invited to participate. Eligible participants were provided with an information sheet and provided informed consent. Transgender and transgender-identified gender non-binary people were not included, as a separate and more focused study was conducted on these individuals by the Generations study team. Participants received a $25 gift certificate for their participation. Participants were screened and enrolled between March 28, 2016, and March 30, 2017. An enhancement oversample of Black and Latinx participants was screened and enrolled between April 1, 2017, and March 30, 2018, to increase the number of these participants ensuring representation. A complete description of the Generations study methods can be accessed at Krueger et al., 2020.\n\n2.3 Sample\nGallup, Inc. initially screened 366,644 participants for eligibility in the Generations study, 3.5% identified as sexual minority people, with 27.5% of those deemed eligible for inclusion based on the eligibility criteria described above. Of those contacted, 80% agreed to participate and 48% completed the survey. The final sample consisted of 1518 sexual minority people ages 18\u201361 years; 53.5% female sex assigned at birth, 64.6% White, 15.7% Black, 19.0% Latinx, 44.1% younger adult and 31.4% older adult. For weighted percentages, see Table 1.\n\n3 RESULTS\nTable 1 displays sociodemographic group membership of the sample. The sample was composed of 60% female assigned at birth and 40% male assigned at birth. Gay/lesbian participants made up 46.9% of the sample followed by 40.6% bisexual, and 12.5% who were coded as \u201cother sexual identity.\u201d Younger participants (18\u201327 years) made up 61.7% of the sample, middle-age group participants (35\u201342) made up 20.9% of the sample and older participants (52\u201361 years) made up 17.4% of the sample. White participants made up the majority of the sample (62.2%), followed by Latinx participants (21.3%) and Black participants (16.5%). Most of the participants lived in urban areas (87%), while the rest in non-urban areas (13%). Those with a bachelor's degree or higher made up 25.6% and those with less than a bachelor's degree was 74.4%. The majority of the sample lived above the FPL (81%) compared to those living below (19%).\n\n3.1 Access to health services\nAmong the sample, 10.4% of participants did not have health insurance coverage, 20.9% did not have a primary care service provider and 13.2% had previously used LGBT-specific health services. Bivariate results by each index of access to health services are presented in Table 2. Results indicated several differences between sociodemographic group membership and access to health services: ...\n",

We argue that\n                    collective learning\u00a0\u2013 and thus survival\u00a0\u2013 is a sociolinguistic phenomenon and lay out a fractal system in which the related\n                    sociolinguistic processes play out. This system highlights the chronotopic-scalar situatedness of survival and captures the\n                    material, textual, and imagined aspects of learning and meaning-making. Drawing on interactions among a small group of Iranian\n                    migrants dealing with the effects of COVID-19, we discuss the processes through which participants dynamically construct and\n                    update their chronotopic images of their new circumstances, as they interact with material and semiotic data coming from multiple\n                    scales/centers. We show how the normative-semiotic indeterminacies caused by COVID-19 are navigated by social actors as they make\n                    sense of their spatiotemporal surroundings in pursuit of material and ideological survival.\n",

Using the staggered passage of constituency statutes across U.S. states between 1983 and 2006, we show that greater stakeholder orientation results in increased tax avoidance. We further find greater tax avoidance among firms with limited financial resources and that employees benefit from the change. Our results are consistent with stakeholder salience theory that resource\u2010constrained managers prioritize the claims of salient stakeholders, such as employees, at the expense of secondary stakeholders, such as the government.\n",

        "abstract": "## ABSTRACT\n\nBusiness students have long been noted for their differential proclivity to engage in academic misconduct. Unfortunately, the potential for misconduct has been exacerbated in recent years by rapid advances in technology, easy access to information, competitive pressures, and the proliferation of websites that provide students access to information that allows them to directly circumvent the learning process. Using a convenience sample of 631 students matriculating in various business majors at four U.S. universities and structural equations modeling procedures, this study assesses the effects of psychological factors on business students\u2019 propensities to utilize the services of homework assistance websites. Specifically, we examine how \u201cDark Triad\u201d personality traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) interact with Fraud Diamond elements to influence student decisions to engage the services of these websites. We find that each Dark Triad trait exerts a significant influence on at least one of the Fraud Diamond elements, which in turn have a significant direct or indirect positive association with students\u2019 reported intentions to utilize, and reported utilization of, these websites.\n\n**KEYWORDS:** Dark Triad, Fraud Diamond, business students, homework assistance websites\n\n**DISCLOSURE STATEMENT**\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\n**Notes**\n1 Chegg.com, Course Hero, and Quizlet are the three largest and most recognizable U.S.-based providers of homework assistance services.\n2 Figures 1 and 2 illustrate hypothesized and measured associations, respectively, and are not intended to imply causality.\n3 Harrison et al.\u2019s (Citation2018) full adaptation contains six items, three that measure primary psychopathy (i.e., morality), and three that measure secondary psychopathy (i.e., impulsiveness). Preliminary analyses indicated that the three secondary psychopathy items had weak loadings on a second-order psychopathy factor, thus prompting us to exclude them from further analysis. The exclusion of these three items enhanced fit of the empirically tested model but did not result in significantly different structural associations among the latent constructs.\n4 Harrison et al. (Citation2018) premised their Fraud Diamond questions centered on the opportunity to earn an additional $100 from overstating the condition of a tablet computer in an online advertisement.\n5 Readers interested in the database used for this study may contact the senior author.\n6 Because not all students at the various institutions were solicited for participation, the 15% figure cited above understates the actual response rate, albeit to an unknown degree due to our inability to feasibly ascertain how many students actually opened and read their e-mail solicitations to participate in the study.\n7 Scott\u2019s (Citation1961) findings are based on analyses of mail survey response rates. With respect to web-based surveys, Wells et al. (Citation2012) prescribe that \u201cSurvey researchers who utilize web-based administrative methods should consider using multiple sources of leverage when soliciting participation and must carefully evaluate sample representativeness\u201d (p. 455). This study\u2019s compliance with these admonitions is evidenced by the multiple means of soliciting student participation, the effort to assess non-response bias reported above, and the gender analyses reported below.\n8 While females comprised approximately 38% of the combined undergraduate business student populations from the participating schools, they comprised 59% of this study\u2019s sample. This finding is congruent with prior research among college students which indicates that female students and ethnic majority students are more likely to respond to paper and web-based surveys (e.g., see, Van Mol, Citation2017). However, this disparity motivated the gender-based moderation analyses reported below.\n9 The business model for both Course Hero and Quizlet is predicated on course-specific, student-provided content.\n10 Hair et al. (Citation2019) caution against putting too much reliance on model fit measures in PLS-SEM.\n11 Hair et al. (Citation2020) note that because composite reliability is weighted it is more accurate than Cronbach\u2019s alpha which is unweighted and suggest that the former is the preferred measure to report: they also indicate that if either of these measures is 0.950 or higher, it is an indication that \u201cthe individual items are measuring the same concept, and are therefore redundant (p. 104).\n12 The correlation between motivation and rationalization (0.940), though above Henseler et al.\u2019s (Citation2015) upper threshold of 0.90, still has an upper interval value below 1.00. Conceptually, the fact that these two constructs are highly correlated is not surprising. Those who have a great deal of motivation to engage in the act would also find it commensurately easier to rationalize the act.\n13 Harrison et al. (Citation2018) did not report f2 values in the comparison study.\n14 See Shmueli et al. (Citation2019) for a full discussion of prediction statistics that can be used to assess the degree of prediction error.\n15 Shmueli et al. (Citation2019) state that the Q2predict value for each indicator must be greater than zero before the RMSE (and/or MAE) values for the PLS-SEM model can compared to the respective na\u00efve linear benchmark values. As Table 8 illustrates, this criterion is satisfied for both Action indicators.\n16 This finding is congruent with prior research (e.g., for a review see, Landay et al., Citation2019).\n17 Smith et al. (Citation2021) used a sample of accounting students to find that the elements of the Dark Triad exerted both unique and synergistic effects on the ethical decision-making process in general, and on rationalization in particular.\n18 Twenty-nine percent of students taking an extra-credit online quiz were presumed to be using a homework assistance website to take assessment before requiring the use of the integrity tool compared to five percent after.\n19 Psychopathy is presumed to be normally distributed in the population with between five and fifteen percent afflicted with subclinical psychopathy and approximately one percent categorized as clinical (LeBreton et al., Citation2006).\n",

We refer to each of these expressions as decompositions of a weight. Our main result considers an infinite family of weights, irrespective of Lie type, for which we establish a closed formula for the q\u2011analog of Kostant\u2019s partition function and then prove that the (normalized) distribution of the number of positive roots in the decomposition of any of these weights converges to a Gaussian distribution as the rank of the Lie algebra goes to infinity.

        "abstract": "This chapter challenges readings of Johnson as empathetic, arguing instead that polemic forms a crucial and habitual aspect of his characteristic style. The polemical qualities of his conversation are analyzed in examples drawn from the biographical. The bulk of the chapter consists of close analysis of his Parliamentary Debates, which are seen in dialogue with other aspects of print and manuscript culture, and argues that the printed form of these debates may be best described as \u201cconcatenated polemic.\u201d The conclusion turns to further examples drawn from Johnson\u2019s late political writing as well as his literary criticism. In sum, Johnson arrives at some of his most significant insights in the heat of controversy, frequently engaging in dialogue with other texts that is deliberately aggressive and unsparing.\n",

These organizations published a significant amount of content, though the frequency declined throughout the summer. Stories mostly framed protesters positively and police negatively. Organizations regularly used law/crime spot news to frame protests. The findings may signal a potential shift away from the media\u2019s protest paradigm.\n",

        "abstract": "While the impact of negative customer treatment on service employees and their organizations is often emphasized in both scholarship and the popular press, relatively little work has examined the effects of customercourtesy. We draw on the social cognitive theory to theorize that customer courtesy can enhance service performance via its positive effect on employee self\u2010efficacy. Although getting customers to display courtesy may be outside an organization's direct control, we reason that management can amplify these benefits by establishing a strong organizational support climate. To examine our predictions, we developed a customer courtesy scale, then deployed it among service employees in the United States (Study 1) and hotel employees and their supervisors in East Asia (Study 2). We also collected experimental data (Study 3) to test our causal model. Across our studies, our data support the benefits of customer courtesy on employee self\u2010efficacy and, by extension, employee service performance. Moreover, our data reveal that when organizational support climate increases, the effect of customer courtesy on self\u2010efficacy and thus, service performance increases. Although it may be the case that bad is sometimes stronger than good, our work highlights the importance of positive workplace interactions (e.g., customer courtesy) on valued employee outcomes.\n",

        "abstract": "Objectives: During the COVID-19 pandemic, university faculty experienced an emergency pivot to online instruction in the Spring 2020 semester. Many had no prior online teaching experience and were given little time to adapt. This study examines pre-pandemic online teaching experience and training strategies used to learn how to teach online during the emergency remote teaching semester, perceptions of change in online teaching ability and the pandemic\u2019s impact on teaching effectiveness, and interest in future online teaching opportunities. Method: Full-time faculty (<em>n</em> = 455) from four public regional universities in the southern United States completed a survey at the start of the Fall 2020 semester. Results: Over 35% had no prior online teaching experience, while 43% had taught several online courses. During the pandemic, in an effort to learn or improve online teaching skills, 13.4% sought peer mentoring, 31.9% completed a training program, and 34.9% both sought mentoring and completed training. Perceived online teaching skills, impact of the pandemic on teaching effectiveness, and interest in future online teaching were significantly related to prior online teaching experience and training sought. Conclusions: Faculty with less online experience perceived a greater negative effect of the pandemic on teaching performance and had less interest in future online teaching. Both mentoring and training enhanced perceived teaching skills, lowered the negative impact of the pandemic on teaching effectiveness, and promoted a positive attitude about future online teaching. Implications for Theory or Practice: The results provide support for the importance of faculty development programs in shaping attitudes and perceived effectiveness in online teaching and add to existent research on university faculty during the pandemic. Evidence from studies such as this provides universities with data that may be used to re-evaluate induction and training to improve instructional delivery in future instances when emergency remote teaching is required.\n",

Several famous VIs have endorsed fashion brands, appearing in the advertising campaigns (e.g., Lil Miquela x Prada). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of using VIs as fashion brand endorsers. Specifically, we tested the impacts of the five perceived characteristics of VIs (attractiveness, innovativeness, curiosity, authenticity, and controllability) on consumer\u2019s attitudes to the advertisement featuring VIs, brand attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward the brand. Data were collected from 252 consumers aged in 18-25 through Amazon MTurk. Structural equation modeling results indicated that the more consumers perceived VIs as attractive, authentic, controllable, and curious, the more positively they reacted to the advertisement featuring VIs as well as to the brand (and vice versa). Brand attitudes influenced behavioral intentions toward the brand. Consumer\u2019s innovativeness and market mavenism were significant moderating variables.\n\n**Keywords:** Virtual influencers, virtual humanoids, influencer marketing\n\n**How to Cite:**\nLee, J. & Park, K., (2022) \u201cI Am a Digital Human\u201d: Effectiveness of Using Virtual Influencers as Fashion Brand Endorsers\u201d, International Textile and Apparel Association Annual Conference Proceedings 79(1). doi: https://doi.org/10.31274/itaa.15991\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe effect of R&D investment on firm performances is subject of a number of internal factors. The dynamics of this effect is unclear in the literature. Based on the knowledge-based view and theory of intellectual capital, this research establishes a theoretical model to test the interrelationships among R&D investment, intellectual capital, organizational learning, and firm performance. We obtained seven years\u2019 panel data from two data centers, and applied mediation and moderation models to investigate the interrelationships. Our findings show while intellectual capital fully mediates the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance, organizational learning moderates the relationship between R&D investment and human capital. Our results show the important roles of intellectual capital and organizational learning in enhancing the effectiveness of R&D investment.\nKeywords: Intellectual capital, organizational learning, software quality, R&D, firm performance\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\nCorrection Statement\nThis article has been corrected with minor changes.

        "abstract": "We used compound\u2010specific isotope analysis of carbon isotopes in amino acids (AAs) to determine the biosynthetic source of AAs in fish from major tributaries to California's Sacramento\u2010San Joaquin river delta (i.e., the Sacramento, Cosumnes and Mokelumne rivers). Using samples collected in winter and spring between 2016 and 2019, we confirmed that algae are a critical component of floodplain food webs in California's Central Valley. Results from bulk stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen in producers and consumers were adequate to characterize a general trophic structure and identify potential upstream and downstream migration into our study site by American shadAlosa sapidissimaand rainbow troutOncorhynchus mykiss, respectively. However, owing to overlap and variability in source isotope compositions, our bulk data were unsuitable for conventional bulk isotope mixing models. Our results from compound\u2010specific carbon isotope analysis of AAs clearly indicate that algae are important sources of organic matter to fish of conservation concern, such as Chinook salmonOncorhynchus tshawytschain California's Central Valley. However, algae were not the exclusive source of energy to metazoan food webs. We also revealed that other sources of AAs, such as bacteria, fungi and higher plants, contributed to fish as well. While consistent with the well\u2010supported notion that algae are critical to aquatic food webs, our results highlight the possibility that detrital subsidies might intermittently support metazoan food webs.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nMatching the supply of medical equipment with soaring demand caused by an epidemic event is a daunting challenge. Focusing on medical equipment manufacturers, this study empirically examines how supply chain management impacts manufacturers\u2019 responses to epidemic-driven demand. This study employs novel supply chain data from South Korea collected before and after the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic event. In the results, we show that such an epidemic positively influences the sales performance of medical equipment manufacturers (i.e. a 10.2 percentage-point increase). To identify the mechanism behind this result, we provide evidence that increasing the supply base (i.e. the number of supply channels) enables medical equipment manufacturers to better respond to epidemic-driven demand and ultimately improves their sales performance. More interestingly, we find that medical equipment manufacturers with lower market status (i.e. lower market shares and lower supplier shares) expand their supply bases more extensively than other medical equipment manufacturers with higher market status do. Interpreting these results, we offer managerial insights into how medical equipment manufacturers can effectively manage their supply chains and improve their performance when responding to epidemic-driven demand.\n\nKEYWORDS: Supply base, supply channel, epidemic and pandemic, epidemic-driven demand, empirical study\n\nData availability statement\nThe data supporting the findings of this study are available from eCredible.

        "abstract": "## Abstract\nPrimary care services are cornerstones for US health care, assuring preventive screening, maintenance of therapeutics, and access to specialty care. Sexual minority (SM) adults are less likely to have access to primary care services than their heterosexual counterparts. Additionally, access to health services among SM persons can vary by age. One plausible explanation for these disparities are experiences of minority stress. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the association between experiences of minority stress and access to primary care services among SM people in the United States across multiple age cohorts. A series of logistic regressions examined associations among multiple experiences of minority stress and access to primary care services. Analyses, stratified by age cohort, examined associations between experiences of minority stress and access to primary care services. Felt stigma, on average, was negatively associated with having a primary care provider among the full sample. The stratified analysis revealed that higher rates of felt stigma were negatively associated with having a primary care provider only among younger SM adults. This study offers novel information suggesting that unique experiences of minority stress are linked with barriers in access to primary care services among SM people.\n\n**Keywords**: Sexual minority adults, primary care services, minority stress\n\n**Disclosure statement** No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\n**Additional information** Funding Generations is funded by a grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD grant 1R01HD078526) and through supplemental grants from the National Institutes of Health, Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, and the Office of Research on Women\u2019s Health.

        "abstract": "The use of evidence in bolstering message believability has been shown in the literature. However, more work is needed to understand the effect of evidence in the monetary donation context for nonprofit organizations. This paper aims to partially close the knowledge gap in this area by (i) comparing the effectiveness of statistical and narrative donation messages on message believability, (ii) investigating the moderating effect of abstract and concrete mindset on the relationship between message type and believability, and (iii) analyzing the resulting effect on subsequent donation intentions. Our findings show that there is no difference in the effect of statistical versus narrative messages on message believability when the recipient of the message is in abstract mindset. However, when the recipient is in concrete mindset, statistical messages lead to stronger believability perceptions. Furthermore, higher believability is found to increase individual monetary donation intentions. \n\n**KEYWORDS**: Nonprofit, evidence type, mindset, message believability, donation intention\n\n**Disclosure statement**: No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\n**Funding**: This work was supported by the Louisiana State University Shreveport [PG009145].\n\n**Notes on contributors**: \n- **Ahmet Koksal**: Assistant Professor in the department of Management and Marketing, College of Business, Louisiana State University in Shreveport.

        "abstract": "## BACKGROUND:\nThe red imported fire ant,Solenopsis invictaBuren, is a significant urban, agricultural, and medical pest with a wide distribution in the world. Surface or mound treatment using contact insecticide is one of the main methods to controlS. invicta. In the present study, cycloxaprid, a newly discovered neonicotinoid insecticide, was evaluated forS. invictacontrol and compared with two referent insecticides, imidacloprid and bifenthrin.\n\n## RESULTS:\nSurfaces or sand treated with cycloxaprid, imidacloprid, or bifenthrin caused high mortality ofS. invictaworkers, and the action of cycloxaprid or imidacloprid was slower than bifenthrin. Like imidacloprid and bifenthrin, cycloxaprid can be horizontally transferred from corpses or live donor ants to recipient ants. In addition, cycloxaprid\u2010 or imidacloprid\u2010treated surfaces significantly induced the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and detoxification enzymes; nevertheless, they had no significant effect on the foraging behaviors ofS. invictaworkers. Also, sand treated with cycloxaprid or imidacloprid did not negatively affect the digging activities of ants. Interestingly,S. invictaworkers excavated significantly more sand containing 0.01\u2009mg/kg cycloxaprid than untreated sand in the no\u2010choice digging bioassays. In addition, extensive nesting activities (sand excavation and stacking) were observed in the flowerpots containing untreated sand or sand treated with cycloxaprid or imidacloprid. On the contrary, bifenthrin significantly reduced the foraging, digging, and nesting activities ofS. invictaworkers.\n\n## CONCLUSION:\nCycloxaprid is a slow\u2010acting and nonrepellent insecticide againstS. invictaworkers, and its contact and horizontal toxicities are slightly higher than imidacloprid. \u00a9 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.\n",

        "abstract": "In this study, we examined the succession of soil microbial communities across a chronosequence of newly constructed salt marshes constructed primarily of fine-grained dredge material, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequences. Alpha diversity in the parent material was initially low and increased to reference levels within 3 years of marsh construction, while in the newly accumulating organic matter-rich surface soils alpha diversity was initially high and remained unchanged. Microbial community succession was fastest in the surface horizon (~\u200924 years to reference equivalency) and became progressively slower with depth in the subsurface horizons (~\u200930\u201367 years). Random forest linear regression analysis was used to identify important taxa driving the trajectories toward reference conditions. In the parent material, putative sulfate-reducers (Desulfobacterota), methanogens (Crenarchaeota, especiallyMethanosaeta), and fermenters (ChloroflexiandClostridia) increased over time, suggesting an enrichment of these metabolisms over time, similar to natural marshes. Concurrently in the surface soils, the relative abundances of putative methane-, methyl-, and sulfide oxidizers, especially amongGammaproteobacteria, increased over time, suggesting the co-development of sulfide and methane removal metabolisms in the marsh soils. Finally, we observed that the surface soil communities at one of the marshes did not follow the trajectory of the others, exhibiting a greater relative abundance of anaerobic taxa. Uniquely in this dataset, this marsh was developing signs of excessive inundation stress in terms of vegetation coverage and soil geochemistry. Therefore, we suggest that soil microbial community structures may be effective bioindicators of salt marsh inundation and are worthy of further targeted investigation.\n",

Predation rates by juveniles (50-90 mm) were examined at 5 daytime light levels (6 \u00d7 1011to 2 \u00d7 1014quanta s-1cm-2) and in darkness and 4 turbidity levels (clear [\u22641], 11, 20, and 40 NTU) at an intermediate light level. Both species fed equally well on benthopelagic mysid shrimp and benthic spionid polychaetes at all daytime light levels tested. However, predation on mysids was significantly reduced in the dark. Consumption of polychaetes was not reduced in the dark by either species, illustrating the effectiveness of non-visual foraging methods on benthic prey. Turbidity levels tested did not affect predation on either prey type by either flounder species. Locomotor behavior was examined at the same turbidity levels.P. lethostigmaspent more time swimming in the water column thanP. dentatusin lower turbidity (clear-20 NTU), and both species reduced swimming at 40 NTU. It appears that both species primarily use a benthic-oriented ambush foraging strategy under high turbidity conditions. This is a particularly pronounced switch in foraging style forP. lethostigma. Estuarine turbidity is increasing due to the impacts of climate change. When turbidity is elevated enough to eliminate light sufficient for visual feeding on mysids (between darkness and the lowest light level tested), feeding on this motile prey is negatively impacted for both species. Turbidity can thus alter foraging modes and types of prey consumed, affecting nursery habitat quality and the prey base supporting these young fishes.\n",

        "abstract": "Land development, pollution, and waste have affected natural environments, contributing to hurricanes, wildfires, and pandemic infectious diseases like COVID-19. Globalized corporate food systems that produce ultra-refined foods with low nutritional value contribute to both environmental conditions and health conditions like obesity and undernutrition. This has the greatest impact on communities already suffering from elevated health risks driven by economic inequities rooted in racism. These interacting environmental, health, and social conditions represent a syndemic. We outline practical suggestions to address this syndemic of environmental degradation, pandemic infectious disease, chronic disease, undernutrition, and inequity through research and practice at many levels, including individual behavior, local communities, and regional, national and global policy. Collaboration with communities is central to simultaneously tackling interconnected human and environmental health threats. For example, community-led groups have increased access to healthy food in response to pandemic conditions. Building on behavioral medicine\u2019s rich foundation of ecological models, communities have partnered with local researchers to address the needs of equitable public transport and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through multilevel research and practice. Policymakers, researchers, practitioners, and community members should collaborate with each other and across disciplines to find lasting, multiduty solutions to improve physical, psychosocial, and planetary health.\n",

        "abstract": "In general, males should be particularly attentive to cues of sexual availability and females should advertize accordingly. Vaginal patency (i.e., the openness of the vagina) is a reliable indicator of sexual maturity; if the vagina is closed, the female is unable to copulate. The southern giant pouched rat (Cricetomys ansorgei) is unusual because females can have fully fused vaginal openings (i.e., vaginal nonpatency) despite being considered \u201cadults\u201d by other metrics. Moreover, some females reversibly close their vaginal openings. Thus, vaginal patency in the pouched rat is a \u201cflexible\u201d reproductive state. We subcutaneously implanted a long-acting GnRH agonist (deslorelin), which over time inhibits sex steroid secretion, to better understand the endocrinology and social behavior relating to vaginal patency in this species. We hypothesized that altering GnRH would impact both patency and behavior through its effects on circulating levels of estradiol. Six months of deslorelin treatment did not alter vaginal patency. Behaviorally, deslorelin-treated females spent less time interacting with, and were more aggressive towards males (compared to controls). Notably, deslorelin did not alter female scent marking. We conclude that behavioral receptivity, but not vaginal patency, is impacted by GnRH hormonal cascades in the pouched rat.\n",

The project provides valid and important results in an immediate sense, while also establishing the foundation for strengthening the media curriculum at educational institutions. For educators, this has positive implications, as along with the traditional content we teach, we also strive to increase the awareness of civic issues among our students to make them better citizens.\n",

        "abstract": "## Background:\nGuidelines allow for the omission of radiotherapy in older women with early\u2010stage, hormone\u2010receptor\u2010positive breast cancer, given that the patients receive adequate endocrine therapy (ET). However, the initiation of ET and survival outcomes after forgoing radiation therapy among these patients have not been well\u2010studied.\n\n## Methods:\nWe identified patients aged 70 to 90\u2009years old newly diagnosed in 2010\u20132015 with early\u2010stage, hormone receptor positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative (HR+/Her2\u2212) breast cancer who received lumpectomy and omitted radiation therapy using the SEER\u2010Medicare database. We examined the initiation of ET and the utilization patterns of ET using a multivariable logistic regression. We further examined the overall survival outcomes using Kaplan\u2013Meier estimation and Cox proportional hazard model with inverse probability weighting.\n\n## Results:\nOf the 2618 patients, 808 (30.9%) received no ET. The multivariable logistic regression showed that more recent years had better ET initiation (2013\u20132015 vs. 2010\u20132012: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI:[1.16, 1.66]), while older patients (81\u201390 vs. 70\u201380: OR\u00a0=\u00a00.45, 95% CI:[0.38, 0.54]) were less likely to receive ET. Both the Kaplan\u2013Meier estimation (log\u2010rank p\u2010value<0.0001) and the Cox proportional hazard model with inverse probability weighting (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.76, 95% CI:[0.58, 0.99]) showed that receiving ET was associated with better overall survival.\n\n## Conclusion:\nThis population\u2010based study suggests that a sizable proportion of patients who omitted radiation did not receive endocrine therapy and receiving endocrine therapy was beneficial among these patients. Although ET initiation has improved in more recent years, certain patient groups were still especially susceptible to no endocrine therapy.\n",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine whether vision-occluded progressive resistance training would increase upper-extremity movement performance using the one-repetition maximum (1-RM) bench press. Participants (n = 57) were recruited from a historically black college and university (HBCU), cross-matched by sex, age (\u00b11 year), 1-RM (\u00b12.27 kg), 1-RM/weight (\u00b10.1), and 1-RM/lean mass ratio (\u00b10.1), and randomly assigned to either the experimental group (vision occluded) or the control group. Participants performed resistance training for 6 weeks prior to beginning the study, and 1-RM was assessed the week prior to the beginning of the study. Weight and body composition were measured using a BOD POD. Of the 57 participants who started the study, 34 completed the study (Experimental = 16, Control = 18) and were reassessed the week after completing the 6-week-long training protocol. Using a combination of Mann\u2013Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, we found that when accounting for changes in lean muscle mass, individuals who trained with their vision occluded reported significantly greater improvements in 1-RM strength compared to those who did not (p < 0.05). The findings from our study suggest that vision-occluded progressive resistance training increases upper-extremity performance when assessed using the bench press. These findings may have significant practical implications in both sports and rehabilitation, as these techniques may be used to enhance performance in athletes and/or improve rehabilitation effectiveness.\n",

        "abstract": "We measure rotational broadening in spectra taken by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey to characterize the relationship between stellar multiplicity and rotation. We create a sample of 2786 giants and 24\u2009496 dwarfs with stellar parameters and multiple radial velocities from the APOGEE pipeline, projected rotation speeds vsin\u2009i determined from our own pipeline, and distances, masses, and ages measured by Sanders\u00a0& Das. We use the statistical distribution of the maximum shift in the radial velocities, \u0394RVmax, as a proxy for the close binary fraction to explore the interplay between stellar evolution, rotation, and multiplicity. Assuming that the minimum orbital period allowed is the critical period for Roche Lobe overflow and rotational synchronization, we calculate theoretical upper limits on expected vsin\u2009i and \u0394RVmax values. These expectations agree with the positive correlation between the maximum \u0394RVmax and vsin\u2009i values observed in our sample as a function of log(g). We find that the fast rotators in our sample have a high occurrence of short-period [log(P/d) \u2272 4] companions. We also find that old, rapidly rotating main-sequence stars have larger completeness-corrected close binary fractions than their younger peers. Furthermore, rapidly rotating stars with large \u0394RVmax consistently show differences of 1\u201310\u00a0Gyr between the predicted gyrochronological and measured isochronal ages. These results point towards a link between rapid rotation and close binarity through tidal interactions. We conclude that stellar rotation is strongly correlated with stellar multiplicity in the field, and caution should be taken in the application of gyrochronology relations to cool stars.\n",
