        "abstract": "The use of smartphones in experimental physics is by now widely accepted and documented. PASCO scientific\u2019s Smart Cart, in combination with student-owned smartphones and free apps, has opened a new universe of low-cost experiments that have traditionally required cumbersome and expensive equipment. In this paper, we demonstrate the simplicity, convenience, and cost-savings achieved by replacing a plethora of traditional motion sensors, wires, interface boards, and other equipment clutter with the smart cart, PASPORT\u00ae High Sensitivity Light Sensor, and the free SPARKvue\u00ae app by carrying out diffraction measurements of light with a single as well as double slit. Rylander and Miller reported a similar experiment but with an ordinary laboratory cart and a motion sensor to extract the precise position of the light sensor. The use of the smart cart in this report obviates the need for using a motion sensor and the laborious extraction of the position data.\n",

However, in-class role-play activities have the potential to create scheduling dilemmas. Mandatory, internal role-play competitions are proposed as a solution to these logistical issues while providing additional professional development benefits to all participants. Results of a repeated-measures study also support that a role-play is more than a tool to refine sales presentation skills, but when administered as an internal competition it not only improves in-class logistics but also positively influence students\u2019 intent to pursue a sales career.\n\nDisclosure Statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\n\nNotes\n1 In a normal class period of 1 hour and 15 minutes an executive can only play a buyer or judge for 5 students or less. During this time the executives do not get to interact with other students.\n",

Why do nonstate armed groups seek the status of sole representatives?, What strategies do they employ to achieve the status of sole representatives?, Is the status merely symbolic, or does it fetch tangible benefits? These research questions are explored by treating Sri Lanka\u2019s LTTE as a case study. Primary and secondary data formed the basis of the analysis. The LTTE used three strategies to achieve a hegemonic disposition within the Tamil community. They are: (1) elimination of rival groups, (2) incorporation of some groups, and (3) battlefield efficacy. The rebels used the claim of sole representation to ensure bilateral talks with the government, get the ban on it lifted, and control the proposed interim administrative structure. The strategy worked to a certain extent, but at least partially contributed to its downfall in 2009.\n\nDisclosure Statement\nThe author has no conflict of interest\n\nNotes\n1.

DiBartolo, PhD, RN-BC, CNE, FGSA, FAAN**  \n**Julie Ann Halick, DCD, PMP**  \n\n**Published Online:** April 01, 2021  \n**Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 2021;47(4):3\u20134**  \n**Cite this article:** https://doi.org/10.3928/00989134-20210309-04  \n**Cited by:** 1\n\n### Introduction\nMassive open online courses (MOOCs) are web-based, fully operational courses designed at scale for open global enrollment. Courses cover a wide array of diverse topics and can vary in terms of effort level and pedagogical approach. They have evolved from an experiment in global course interactions to offering college credit, professional certifications, professional development credits, college course supplemental material, incorporation in college campus education, and career gap\u2013specific courses while reaching as many learners as possible. Most are associated with universities and taught by professors, produced via a partnership of universities with online learning platforms, such as edX\u00ae and Coursera. A variety of educational tools can be incorporated, such as interactive modules, video lectures, reference materials, assessments, collaborative lessons, discussion boards, and peer-reviewed assignments. Newer MOOCs feature chatbots and adaptive algorithm models that adjust to learners' prior knowledge and question responsiveness. They can be easily accessed by anyone, provided they have an internet connection, language proficiency (most are only available in English), and computer literacy (Setia et al., 2019). Many MOOCs offer an audit track, which provides access to all course materials for a limited time except graded assignments; they are typically free but learners are unable to earn a \u201ccertificate\u201d under this option. To earn a verified certificate, learners pay a fee and must complete specified assessments, discussions, and/or other assigned learning activities.\n\nMillions of learners of various ages, backgrounds, interests, and goals typically enroll in these courses. As a form of e-learning, MOOCs continue to emerge as a particularly valuable strategy to address some of the training challenges experienced in developing countries by supporting efficient content delivery, decreasing costs, and increasing access (Liyanagunawardena & Aboshady, 2018). MOOCs have been shown to significantly improve outreach regarding public health concerns, as well as providing necessary training for health care professionals and the general public. The most recent report presented at the edX Virtual Forum (2020) documents >35 million learners with 110 million unique enrollments spanning 196 countries. Furthermore, MOOCs are particularly suited for addressing health topics while attracting global learners from low-resource contexts (Barteit et al., 2019). Currently, health and medicine are estimated to account for only a small percentage of MOOCs; topics have included nutrition, stress management, alternative therapies, mental health, ethics, global health, and health care leadership. Other courses are more disease- or condition-specific, such as hypertension, menopause, and pediatric injuries, as well as HIV and addiction. However, what seems to be substantially lacking are courses focused on conditions related to aging and issues impacting older adults.\n\nAs part of a concerted effort to address this dearth of gero-focused content, two MOOCs were launched by Salisbury University's School of Nursing in conjunction with USMx, an initiative through the University System of Maryland's William E. Kirwan Center for Academic Innovation (access  https://www.edx.org/course/overview-management-ofparkinsons-disease-2;  https://www.edx.org/course/alzheimers-disease-dementia-care). The two courses, titled Overview of Parkinson's Disease & Management and Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Care, were purposely designed to appeal to lay persons and caregivers, as well as health care professionals working with these patient populations. These courses include a variety of teaching modalities to enhance learner engagement, such as introductory/summary videos for each of the five modules, check your knowledge questions, web links, embedded visuals/videos, as well as video interviews with a person with Parkinson's disease and an Alzheimer's care-giver, respectively, followed by reflective discussion. The response to these self-paced, gero-focused offerings has been overwhelmingly positive, and data show the goal of reaching a wide audience with varying skills was exceeded within the first year. Collectively, there are >12,000 learners and growing, reaching more than 140 countries, with the United States only making up 15% to 20% of the enrolled population. Of these learners who self-reported demographic information for the two courses, approximately 65% are female and 35% are male and median age is 28 years. Approximately 26% have a high school diploma or less, and 24% have an advanced degree. Although these MOOCs, which launched in late 2019/early 2020, likely experienced heightened interest due to the COVID-19\u2013induced lockdown worldwide, the far-reaching nature of these courses as a cost-effective way to introduce a widespread audience to pertinent gerontological topics of interest is markedly clear.\n\nEven with their growing popularity, scholarly debate continues regarding benefits versus concerns when offering free and open content to an international audience. Limitations can include low-quality or non-engaging instruction, passive learning, course difficulty, and low average completion rates despite free content (Setia et al., 2019). High drop-out rates remain a much-criticized issue (Chan et al., 2019). Suggested strategies for improving participation and completion rates while enhancing perceived value would include offering courses of shorter duration and incorporating good-quality media. Furthermore, advertising courses through multiple credible channels (including social media platforms) can spread awareness about e-learning opportunities (Setia et al., 2019). Incentives can include offering certificates, credits, or professional credit; providing learning support and learner feedback; and using data to analyze drop-out points to drive course improvements (Chan et al., 2019).\n\nMOOCs can provide a free and accessible way for learners to be exposed to new topics or disciplines while providing a forum to stimulate new interests and ideas. They can serve as an effective and efficient method to provide education regarding health topics while creating a diverse and interactive community of global learners. MOOCs that address issues specific to the geriatric population can go beyond disease-oriented topics to those that explore broader concerns related to aging, such as polypharmacy, health promotion, transitions in care, end-of-life decision making, and the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in optimizing care outcomes. Although MOOCs can be resource-intensive to develop, the rewards of educating a global audience can be particularly satisfying. High-quality MOOCs developed by knowledgeable faculty and/or expert health care professionals can provide a learning environment where gerontological nurses and other health care providers, as well as lay persons/caregivers from various geographic regions, cultures, and backgrounds, can connect and share experiences. Nursing faculty, in collaboration with practicing gerontological nurses, have the opportunity to provide cutting edge MOOCs to not only enhance learning among students and health care peers to enhance practice, but also inform the global community at large about pertinent geriatric topics.\n",

        "abstract": "Although the influence of regulations on economic outcomes has been well documented, few studies have focused on the geography of regulatory burdens. The regulations confronting any supply chain can vary dramatically across legislative jurisdictions, as U.S. policy is enforced by overlapping federal, state, and local governments. We use a unique data set to explore state\u2010by\u2010state regulatory variation in U.S. beer supply chains in 2020. We find that the state\u2010level rules targeted at the beer supply chain vary between 1,177 and 25,399, with the average state implementing 10,212 formal regulatory restrictions.\n",

        "abstract": "As COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, health researchers and practitioners have focused attention on identifying the factors that may help to shape health-protective behaviors, protecting individual health and well-being, and helping to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This study explores the potential role of self-leadership and psychological capital (PsyCap) as key cognitive resources for shaping health-protective behaviors. Using multiple theoretical frameworks (social cognitive theory, psychological resources theory, and the health belief model), this paper develops and tests a hypothesized serial mediation model in which PsyCap and coping self-efficacy mediate the relationship between self-leadership and health-protective behaviors including hand washing, wearing face masks, and social distancing. Results suggest that PsyCap and coping self-efficacy mediate the positive relationship between self-leadership and health-protective behaviors. These results yield valuable insights regarding the usefulness of self-leadership and PsyCap as cognitive resources for shaping health-protective behaviors and for possible self-leadership and PsyCap interventions, potentially tailored to at-risk populations, which should have practical benefits for both the current and future pandemics and health crises.\n",

        "abstract": "Tidal processes regulating sediment accretion rates and vegetated platform erosion in tidal systems strongly affect salt marsh evolution. A balance between erosion and deposition in a restored salt marsh is crucial for analyzing restoration strategies to be adopted within a natural context. Marsh morphology is also coupled with tidal mudflats and channel networks and this makes micro-tidal systems crucial for a detailed assessment of restoration interventions. Here, we present a methodological approach for monitoring channel morphodynamics and vegetation variations over a time frame of six years in a low tidal energy salt marsh of the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island (Maryland, USA). The project is a restoration site where sediment dredged from the shipping channels in the upper Chesapeake Bay is used to restore a tidal marsh habitat in mid-Chesapeake Bay. Aerial surveys with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) have been performed for the high-resolution mapping of a small tidal system. Flight missions were planned to obtain a Ground Sample Distance (GSD) of 2 cm. Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) algorithms have been used to reconstruct the 3D geometry of the site. The mapping of channel morphology and an elevation assessment on the mudflat were performed using orthomosaics, Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) and GNSS survey. The results highlight that the workflow adopted in this pilot work is suitable to assess the geomorphological evolution over time in a micro-tidal system. However, issues were encountered for salt marsh due to the presence of dense vegetation. The UAV-based photogrammetry approach with GNSS RTK ground surveys can hence be replicated in similar sites all over the world to evaluate restoration interventions and to develop new strategies for a better management of existing shorelines.\n",
