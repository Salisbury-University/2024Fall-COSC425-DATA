        "abstract": "The use of blood flow restriction (BFR) exercise in athletic and clinical settings has increased in the last five years. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of autoregulated (AR) and non-autoregulated (NAR) BFR biceps curl exercise on arterial stiffness. AR BFR cuffs adjust pressure as the muscle undergoes concentric and eccentric contractions, maintaining a constant pressure in the limb throughout the entire range of motion. NAR BFR training cuffs do not adjust pressure throughout the range of motion thus causing greater pressures in the limb during concentric contraction when the muscle size is enlarged. How this exercise acutely impacts arterial stiffness in upper body exercise is not well understood. METHODS: Following a randomized familiarization period with AR or NAR BFR biceps curl exercise, 33 adults (20 \u00b1 2 years; 11 females) participated in 3 randomized sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no-BFR (no cuffs) separated by 1-week washout periods. Using 20% of the 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) with 2-second concentric/eccentric cadence, participants performed 4 sets of biceps curls to failure. Training limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both BFR sessions. Measurements before and immediately following the training session included blood pressure acquisition, arterial tonometry, and ultrasonography of the carotid artery. Between and within effects of treatment on central systolic blood pressure (cSBP), central diastolic BP (cDBP), central pulse pressure (cPP), central mean arterial pressure (cMAP), pulse wave velocity (PWV), beta-stiffness index (\u03b2-stiff), and arterial compliance (AC) were analyzed with two-way ANOVAs. RESULTS: There were no baseline differences in variable of interest (all p > 0.05). cDBP increased posted exercise in all three groups (AR-BFR mean difference (MD) = 7 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01; NAR-BFR MD = 6 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01; no BFR MD = 5 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01). And there was a non-significant trend in \u03b2-stiff (MD = 1.25 \u00b1 0.46 au, p = 0.07) and AC (MD = -0.3 \u00b1 0.1 mm2/mmHg x 10-1, p = 0.07) with the no BFR treatment. CONCLUSION: The present findings show acute AR-BFR and NAR-BFR bicep training did not impact arterial stiffness.\n",

        "abstract": "Predation can lead to nonlethal injury as well as mortality in turtles, with many Clemmys guttata (Spotted Turtle) having predator-induced limb and foot amputations. The impact of such injuries on movements of freshwater turtles remains poorly understood. We tracked Spotted Turtles (n = 20) in a single population on the Delmarva Peninsula using radio telemetry for \u223c1 year. Seven turtles had at least 1 limb or foot completely amputated by a predator, and the remaining 13 were uninjured. When comparing movements among turtles, we found no difference in home-range sizes between male (n = 8) and female (n = 7) nor between injured (n = 7) and uninjured (n = 8) Spotted Turtles during their breeding season. However, injured turtles (n = 5) had smaller home ranges (mean \u00b1 SE = 0.26 \u00b1 0.14 ha) than uninjured turtles (n = 12, 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 ha) during the nonbreeding season, when turtles are more terrestrial. Our findings suggest a potential ecological cost of nonlethal injury, as predator effects might extend beyond simple mortality.\n",

        "abstract": "## Problem:\nThe Eastern Shore of Maryland is a beautiful region that boasts a multicultural community of 455,000 year-round residents. Despite its rural location, the coastal lifestyle attracts retirees, making it the state\u2019s oldest population. Unfortunately, the region also has the highest socioeconomic disparities in the state, which creates difficulties in accessing healthcare. This is a significant public health issue that results in costly barriers to preventive care and timely, accounting for $320 billion in unnecessary healthcare spending.\n\n## Description of the problem:\nMaryland\u2019s healthcare funding formulas favor larger health systems in urban areas, leading to health inequities. To address this, we propose an innovative scenario analysis model partially based on European public health approaches. This model will adjust funding formulas based on each region\u2019s specific needs and challenges, promoting fairness and equity in healthcare funding.\n\n## Results:\nAdopting this population health management approach would have built-in efficiencies: In the United States, healthcare spending tends to be higher among underserved populations due to delayed care, access challenges, missed diagnoses, and limited access to the latest scientific advances as well as proper preventive services.\n\n## Lessons:\nThe proposed scenario-based public health funding approach targeting the needs of the underserved population on the Eastern Shore of Maryland could yield significant positive health outcomes and health savings generating a ripple effect across the state, and perhaps even the country. The lessons learned in how other countries handle public health funding could lead to global collaboration.\n\n## Key messages:\n\u2022\u2002Our approach aims to provide a practical solution to unnecessary healthcare spending.\n\n\u2022\u2002We must adapt to the changing tides to stay on course.\n",
