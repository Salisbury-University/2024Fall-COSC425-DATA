Salisbury University, Salisbury, MD.\n2. UMES, Princess Anne, MD.\n3. Lehman College, New York, NY. (Sponsor: Tim Werner, FACSM)\nEmail: szupnik1@gulls.salisbury.edu\n(No relevant relationships reported)\n\nPublished in: Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise 56(10S):p 964-965, October 2024. | DOI: 10.1249/01.mss.0001060920.34828.c8\n\n**PURPOSE:** To characterize the effects of upper and lower body autoregulated blood flow restriction (AR-BFR), non-autoregulated BFR (NAR-BFR), and no BFR on rating perceived exertion (RPE), rating perceived discomfort (RPD), and gauge of a 1-10 Likert scale on the likelihood of performing the exercise training again. AR-BFR pressure cuffs adjust pressure automatically, maintaining a similar pressure during concentric and eccentric phases. However, NAR-BFR pressure cuffs do not accommodate for larger muscle diameters during the concentric phase, creating higher limb pressures compared to the eccentric phase.\n\n**METHODS:** 33 adults (21 \u00b1 2 years; 11 females) participated in upper body sessions and 20 adults (23 \u00b1 5 years; 7 females) in lower body sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no BFR in a randomized fashion separated by 1-week including a familiarization session. All participants in the upper body sessions performed four sets of dumbbell curls and those in the lower body sessions performed four sets of wall squats with handheld dumbbells to volitional fatigue using 20% of their 1-RM with 2-second cadence and 1 minute rest periods. Cuffs were placed at the proximal portion of the arms and thighs, and limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both BFR treatments during exercise and rest periods for both sessions. Subjective measurements of RPE, RPD, and the 1-10 Likert scale were taken immediately post-exercise while the cuffs were inflated. Two-way ANOVAs were conducted on variables of interest.\n\n**RESULTS:** There were no significant differences in RPE between AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no BFR in the upper and lower body sessions (p = 0.13). A significant difference in RPD was found between upper body AR-BFR and no BFR (mean difference (MD) = 2.23 \u00b1 0.47, p < 0.01) and upper body NAR-BFR and no BFR (mean difference (MD) = 1.32 \u00b1 0.47, p = 0.05).\n\n**CONCLUSION:** The use of BFR does not appear to influence subjective ratings of exertion in the upper and lower limbs. Additionally, AR-BFR and NAR-BFR devices may cause more subjective discomfort compared to no BFR.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by the American College of Sports Medicine.\n",

We examined rape victim empathy based on type of rape experience (none, incapacitated, forcible, combined). Undergraduate women ( n\u2009=\u2009658) completed the Rape Victim Empathy-During Subscale and Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization. Rape experience was associated with greater empathy, especially for those with any forcible experience. Perhaps due to weaker memory of their own rape event, incapacitated victims may be relatively less able than forcible victims to understand another victim's perspective during a rape. Researchers should consider examining incapacitated and forcible rape as distinct experiences.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nKorean immigrant fathers were interviewed and the consensual qualitative research (CQR) method was employed to analyze the data. Five domains (challenges, identity, values, relationship, and well-being) and seventeen categories emerged. Participants experienced implicit discrimination and cultural barriers. They identified themselves as Koreans and valued family\u2019s well-being as their priority. They made efforts to find meaning and satisfaction by supporting children to become independent adults. Participants were aware of their traditional parenting styles and the intergenerational cultural gap with their children. As first-generation immigrants, Korean immigrant fathers reported a lack of genuine relationships with both Korean Americans and non-Korean Americans outside of their families.

        "abstract": "A Mass Spectrometry Experiment on the Degrees of Freedom Effect\n\n\nAbstract\n\nAn experiment is described that allows students to investigate the physical chemistry involved in unimolecular fragmentation and to explain their experimental results using Rice\u2013Ramsperger\u2013Kassel (RRK) theory. For the experiment, students prepare a solution of a series of homologous analytes and collect mass spectra of those analytes using GC-MS. All the analytes undergo the same three-step fragmentation in the mass spectrometer. The relative peak intensities from the ions in the fragmentation scheme are plotted as a function of the vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecular ions\u2019 R group. Trends in these plots can be explained using concepts from RRK theory and highlight the \u201cdegrees of freedom effect\u201d in mass spectrometry. The experiment is suitable for a variety of upper-level, undergraduate chemistry laboratories.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nTo investigate the acute effects of 4 sets of autoregulated (AR-BFR) versus non-autoregulated (NAR-BFR) applied pressures during blood flow restriction (BFR) resistance exercise to volitional failure compared with low-load exercise without BFR. A randomized crossover design study was conducted on 32 healthy adults (20.8 \u00b1 2.3 years; 11 females). Outcome measures were as follows: (1) arterial stiffness, (2) peak perceptual responses and likelihood to perform again, and (3) performance. Results: Post-exercise changes in central and brachial diastolic blood pressure were decreased in all groups. Post-exercise supine systolic blood pressure in no-BFR increased (mean difference (MD) = -4 \u00b1 1 mmHg, 95% CI (1\u20137), p = 0.003, \u03b72 = 0.13). Total repetitions performed and volume workload were similar between BFR conditions but less than no-BFR. AR-BFR reported significantly higher exertion (MD = -0.53 \u00b1 0.2, 95% CI (0.04\u20131.0), p = 0.03, \u03b72 = 0.19) than other conditions, and induced greater discomfort (MD = -2.50 \u00b1 0.36, 95% CI (1.63\u20133.37), p < 0.001, \u03b72 = 0.28) than no-BFR. Conclusion: Biceps curl exercise to volitional failure appears to induce negligible arterial stiffness or blood pressure changes regardless of the application of autoregulation, yet autoregulation appears to enhance the perceptual response to BFR exercise compared to NAR-BFR without impacting exercise performance.\n\nKEYWORDS: BFR therapy, central stiffness, pulse wave velocity\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe wish to thank Delfi Medical for loaning the devices used within this study for research purposes.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The importance of employee-owned (EO) organizations around the world is increasing. Countries, communities and organizations are realizing that passing profits to workers increases wealth at all levels of society. The benefits, widely known, include personal prosperity, organizational profitability and stability, and a host of economic benefits for communities in which EO companies operate. Selling a company to employees, or starting a cooperative organization containing worker owners, is not without risk. New skills are required for the company to reap the rewards inherent in EO organizations, but the method of creating this change varies significantly from one organization to another. Each is unique, but there are some factors that are common to most EO organizations that have achieved a dynamic organizational culture. These factors, which are critical for success, can be isolated using structured research, organized through a lens of general systems theory and operationalized using principles of Learning Management (LM). The result is an organized knowledge transfer plan that maximizes resources and provides the highest probability of a successful transition to a uniquely profitable EO company. KEYWORDS: Employee ownership, knowledge transfer, learning management, critical success factors, engagement culture. JEL CLASSIFICATION: O43\n\n1. Overview Research indicates that extraordinarily successful employee-owned (EO) organizations have a culture that supports everyday employee engagement (Berry and Fitz-Gerald Citation2018), making a unique contribution to the prosperity of the organization. Why this occurs is the subject of ongoing research designed to discover what factors contribute to employee-ownership principles, and result in increases in revenues and profitability. Literature containing information on high-performing work systems (HPWS) seems to lay a foundation for EO practices (Calo and Shipper, Citation2018), but the commitment, and ownership mentality occurs in highly successful organizations that are owned by employees in trusts, cooperative agreements, or through equity arrangements. The results of EO are well documented and include organizations outperforming competitors in a variety of areas (Kruse Citation2022), attracting and maintaining top talent (Kurland Citation2018) increases in innovation and efficiency (Agafitei and Avasilcai Citation2015), and resilience during economic downturns. For employee-owners, the benefits are also substantial and include job satisfaction and security (Uzuriaga, 2028), increased motivation (Blasi et al. Citation2008) and of course the financial rewards that come from owning equity in the organization, among others. One of the largest benefits of EO, however, may be the economic benefits seen by communities when workers become owners (Inserra, Conway, and Rodat Citation2002). Jobs are preserved and increased in local communities (J. R. Blasi, Freeman, and Kruse Citation2013), and stability is improved with the longer-term outlook of EO organizations. EO companies also tend to have a reciprocal commitment to the communities in which they reside, contributing to an upward spiral of growth and economic prosperity. Some scholars note that EO organizations have higher levels of commitment to the environment, locally and beyond, and often engage in practices that are ecologically and socially sustainable. None of these benefits are realized merely because of transferring ownership to employees. They become a reality when employees begin to think like owners \u2013 at all levels of the organization. The first portion of this paper is dedicated to the factors that create this unique culture within EO organizations, and the latter is devoted to operationalizing \u2013 actually transforming \u2013 workers into owners. This paper delivers a set of critical success factors (CSFs) of employee ownership as discovered in approximately 100 carefully curated articles, cases, and books dedicated to the subject of employee engagement in EO organizations. CSF research is appropriate because it is designed to produce a set of factors that must receive top priority during a high-stakes implementation (Ram and Corkindale Citation2014), and if they are neglected, the likelihood of success decreases significantly. CSF is used to manage enterprise-wide change initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions, complex software implementations and other major projects (Trkman Citation2010). Becoming employee-owned requires a level of business acumen that needs to be supported by research, which must be translated into activities that will contribute directly to the success of the firm. Using the methods outlined in the next section, a metasynthesis was undertaken that yielded CSFs and their context, as reported by dozens of successful organizations. The broad CSFs discovered in the literature are as follows: Accountability/Responsibility, Communication, Governance, Innovation, Leadership, Working in Teams, Training, Transparency (Especially in Finance). There were other CSFs identified in the literature that were shown to be a result of attending to other CSFs over time. This paper was developed to explain the process of implementing employee ownership, and the below are outcomes. Culture \u2013 Values Engagement HR Practices Recruiting Selection On Boarding Training and Development Rewards and Recognition Retention\n2. Research methods There are several principles and practices underpinning the research application to CSFs. The first is the method for determining the CSFs themselves. This involves a metasynthesis of a large body of literature using a qualitative software system, NVivo. The process of discovering CSFs is employed to ensure the accuracy and validity of the study. The paper is also grounded in the general systems theory, which provides a foundation for modelling the before and after state of an organization as it moves into an EO culture. Finally, principles of Learning Management (LM) are used to operationalize the transformation. Each of these practices is explained in the next section.\n2.1. Critical success factor research CSF research is used to create benchmarks that track the performance of implementations in high-risk situations. These are typically used before, during, and after implementations (Zheng, Yang, and McLean Citation2010). The results of this paper can be used to evaluate the processes necessary to reduce the risk of converting to employee ownership and should be used by advisors and top managers who typically make decisions and allocate resources during the planning and execution of complex ventures. CSFs, used in a variety of industries and for a purposes, dates to the 1960s and has undergone continuous revisions. Jack Rockart of Massachusetts Institute of Technology popularized CSF methodology in the late 1970s for practicing managers (Aziz, Salleh, and Mustafa Citation2012; Bullen and Rockart Citation1981). More recently, business researchers have adopted this methodology in a variety of settings including operations (Netland Citation2016), change management (Kash et al. Citation2014; Trkman Citation2010), project management (Chih and Zwikael Citation2015; Ika, Diallo, and Thuillier Citation2012), enterprise systems implementations (Ram and Corkindale Citation2014), logistics (Denolf et al. Citation2015; Luthra, Garg, and Haleem Citation2015) and others. Scientifically predicting CSFs for a given initiative starts with an analysis of literature concerning past projects. The objective of the analysis is to learn what worked in the past during similar initiatives (Hanafizadeh et al. Citation2012). CSF research typically includes several phases, the first of which is desk research which was undertaken for this project. CSFs for high-risk initiatives requires conducting a metasynthesis of prior research, then verifying analysis results with a qualitative phase (phenomenological interviews), and an empirical research project in the form of broad-based surveys among those who have lived the experience of becoming employee owned. In the metasynthesis phase of the study, relevant materials are identified, reviewed and coded using qualitative research software, in this case, NVivo. The literature analysis yielded a set of reliable CSFs because a substantial portion of the documents used are case studies that provide in-depth research into the factors that create the desired EO culture. In the second and third phases of CSF research, the factors may be ranked in order of importance and dependencies, organized in terms of stakeholders who will bear responsibility, and evaluated for feasibility (Akhavan and Zahedi Citation2014). A strong research model is necessary to ensure the value of CSFs (Dabestani, Taghavi, and Saljoughian Citation2014) and researchers must evaluate not only the variety and nature of CSFs, but the methods and variables inherent in similar past projects (Chien Citation2014). Using standard research methods to explore CSFs allows researchers to consider extraordinarily complex interactions that managers might overlook and that could contribute to organizational performance (Hesselmann and Kunal Citation2014). Although research methods for determining CSFs are standard, industries vary as do types and complexities of initiatives (Arif and Shalhoub Citation2014), so CSFs differ from one study to another (Keramati et al. Citation2012). In the case of this project, however, EO organizations exhibited similar attributes, and some sources provided specific details concerning how the transformation from employees to owners was achieved over time. Understanding the methods for determining CSFs might be as useful as the CSFs themselves, because undertaking research to determine probable CSFs creates an awareness of a broad range of factors that should receive consideration in complex business undertakings (Ab Talib and Abdul Hamid, Citation2014). Most articles containing empirical studies on CSFs yielded both a general methodology for establishing CSFs and specific CSFs that may be applicable to high-risk projects of diverse types.\n2.2. General systems theory The principles of Learning Management (LM) are grounded in general systems theory. Where humans are involved, there will be knowledge transfer to affect change. The system can be a person, community, or larger economy. In this paper, we are concerned with EO organizations and what parts of the system make them high performing. Using CSFs, the metasynthesis was used to create a model for a general system that demonstrates high employee engagement. To apply this information, a basic understanding of general systems theory, the process of modelling and how these are used in scientific research, provides the foundation for using LM to systematically shift a system, in this case an EO organization, into a new state. Von Bertalanffy (Citation1950) explained that general systems theory creates a method for reliably researching complex systems. The first is that an entire system is dependent on several subsystems, each of which are dependent on itself and other subsystems. In an organization, these may be teams or departments. The system also interacts with the environment and changes over time. The effects of ownership on communities and larger economies are an example of how an organization, as a system, affects is surroundings. General systems theory is applicable to almost any system, but to study a complex EO organization, the subsystems must be identified and modelled, to create a framework. The CSFs, explained in detail later, are used as a benchmark to design interventions, identify methods of improvement and form a foundation for theoretical assumptions that can be used in similar situations. Case studies in the literature collection provided evidence of a system that shifted to create a new, high-performing organization. The literature was lacking in a clear method of knowledge transfer that provided reliable results, although there were plenty of disparate examples of dynamic transformation. General systems theory allows the researcher to create a clear path for growth and change, while allowing for the unique attributes of EO organizations in many industries, and of all sizes. To operationalize the transformation of a system that involves knowledge transfer, LM principles help simplify the process.\n2.3. Principles of learning management (LM) The first step in developing a learning program to increase ownership culture, is to conduct a gap analysis. Using the concepts of systems theory, develop a before and after model of the EO organization. With roots in change management, and applicable to a variety of initiatives, this classic analysis can be conducted by the top management team (TMT), the human resources (HR) team, or outside advisors, with input from supervisors and workers at various levels of the organization. Evaluate the current state of employees. What do they know now and what type of knowledge programs are currently being offered? The transformation to ownership practices will require new knowledge, and the gap is filled with learning programs. Between the employee and owner mindset are knowledge requirements, which will vary by organization. The only constant is that every person in the organization will need additional information concerning ownership, and the new responsibilities of employee owners. Fortunately, there is a finite number of ways knowledge is transferred in most organizations. Considering the change required, however, may yield an array of variables that must be considered before investing time and money in developing employees. Each company has resources which are limited in some way. Each industry has certain types of learners that must be considered. For example, from the TMT to the least-paid employee in a professional services firm, there may be few differences in learners. Workers have the same level of education and similar backgrounds. In a manufacturing firm, however, there may be many layers of employee \u2018types\u2019 from well-educated, to highly skilled, to less skilled and those for whom literacy is a challenge. When strategizing how to maximize the CSFs among workers, consider each of the available methods of knowledge transfer. And although training is considered essential for optimal EO performance, it is rarely ready at the onset of the conversion to employee ownership, so careful planning is necessary. Picking knowledge transfer strategies that will have broad impact for a wide audience, at the best possible price, is the goal of LM. The list below is shown from least expensive to most expensive, and least controlled to most controlled. When we review the CSFs in detail, each of the LM strategies below should be evaluated as a means to facilitate the transformation process. Informal Discussions, Formal and Informal Mentoring, Communications, Signage (Hard Copy and Online), Published Policies and Processes, Experience and On the Job Training, Training.\n2.3.1. Informal discussions Informal discussions happen in regular work activities throughout the organization. Tacit means spoken, or observed knowledge, while explicit (codified) is written. Some people refer to knowledge as informal and formal. The important thing to remember is that informal conversations happen all the time, and they are the most important aspect of employees gaining information. The more informed the leaders of each team, department, or committee concerning the benefits of EO, the better. Discussions start the moment an announcement is made that the company will become employee owned.\n2.3.2. Mentoring Mentoring occurs continuously, but it is usually more formal in that a junior employee is paired with a more experienced co-worker. In some industries, mentoring is common and highly formalized with expected and documented outcomes. But in many cases, a senior worker will assume the responsibility whether a mentoring program exists or not. When starting out on the EO journey, leaders at all levels should be identified and receive communication concerning the benefits of EO.\n2.3.3. Communication Communication in this context refers to formal communication \u2013 sometimes spoken and at other times written. When embarking on EO, it is wise to create a communication plan that includes information from the TMT (or informed advisors of the company), in the form of meetings, emails, videos or other appropriate methods for getting the word out. Most mature ESOPS have annual, quarterly, and/or monthly meetings designed to inform the owners on the financial state of the company. It is common to have the CEO or other important figure communicate ownership information through emails or briefs monthly, or in some cases weekly. How you communicate with employee-owners will depend on how they learn in general. If an employee works on a computer, email may be appropriate. A front-line employee with limited access to company computers may rely on verbal communication from team leaders and supervisors.\n2.3.4. Hard and digital signage Signage helps control processes at all levels of society. Signs are inexpensive but can have a tremendous impact on virtually unlimited numbers of people. For example, a sign that shows the proper direction to a location can help thousands of people arrive at a destination. Signs that remind people of the values and mission of an organization keep everyone focused on what matters most. Signs can communicate information that contributes to a source of pride in an organization. Excellent safety records, exemplary customer service and employee recognition are but a few common forms of signage found in organizations. Tailor signage to remind people that they are now owners. Direct them to further resources. Place a QR code on a sign that takes people to relevant information concerning their new role as owners. This is a valuable and inexpensive method of transferring knowledge.\n2.3.5. Published policies and procedures Policies and procedures will be updated beginning almost immediately. As time moves forward, and employees become more capable of making decisions (for example) that improve company performance, these policies will evolve. For instance, in an employee setting, decisions may be made at the supervisor level. It is common for employee owners to make decisions for customer facing issues. Ideas also tend to come from all levels. Innovation and risk taking are more common when employees assume ownership responsibilities. These transitions can be formalized by creating and publishing policies.\n2.3.6. Experience and on the job training On-the-job training is the most common type of training in most organizations. It is inexpensive and readily available. To be effective, however, each supervisor, mentor, or team leader must be \u2018trained\u2019 to be a trainer. As employee ownership becomes a priority within the organization, these trainers, found at all levels of an organization, must be made aware of new expectations and conduct concerning taking ownership of day-to-day activities. This \u2018train-the-trainer\u2019 training occurs formally.\n2.3.7. Formal training and development Training is the most expensive form of employee development and should be undertaken when outcomes need to be measured. Training is designed to hold people accountable to performance. So, if a concept is merely \u2018good to know\u2019 use one of the above methods to convey knowledge. Onboarding is formal training for new employees, and this will evolve as ownership becomes commonplace in the organization. Because owners can grow into a variety of roles at many levels of an organization, some companies engage in \u2018Everboarding\u2019 by providing required training on a quarterly basis, or as the company evolves. Examples of training might include basic finance or cost accounting, something that regular workers would never need to know, but might help employee owners contribute meaningfully to the organization, and in turn, their own wealth.\n3. Results of the CSF metasynthesis Recall that NVivo was used to cull through large volumes of literature yielding not only the CSFs themselves, but also the context in which they occur. The cases and references used in the metasynthesis, are listed in the reference section with an asterisk (*). These CSFs are mentioned briefly in the Overview section of the paper, and a more thorough explanation of each CSF, in context, is presented below. NVivo delivers CSFs in context by showing the words immediately before and after the term. Any reference can immediately be accessed for further information. To illustrate how the software delivers information in context, see the samples below.\n3.1. Accountability Accountability or responsibility were referenced 200 times in over 50 different sources. The sources showed a number of items for which employees were held accountable, and types of responsibility. Attributes of responsibility were also revealed. Financial Responsibility (Profits), Assuming Responsibility for Various Functions, A Sense of Collective Responsibility, Developing a System of Responsibilities, Responsible to Others, Ongoing Commitment and Responsibility, Increased Levels of Responsibility, How to Acknowledge Responsibility.\n3.2. Communication Communication was expanded in the NVivo qualitative search criteria to include synonyms, which yielded over 100 mentions in 74 sources. The research revealed the importance of communication through the following broad themes: TMT (Top Management Team) Communication, Information Sharing, Team and Committee Communication, Setting and Promoting Levels of Expected Communication, Lack of Communication is a Problem, Establishing Channels of Communication, Creating Formal Expectations Concerning Communication, Increased Need for Interpersonal Communication.\n3.3. Governance The results of the term governance yielded some unexpected results, which indicated that not only was governance important at the top levels of the organization, but also throughout the entire workforce. This probe resulted in over 4,200 references in 80 files. Some of the important aspects of governance are: Transitioning Governance to Incorporate EO, Levels of Changing Control and Governance, Guidelines for Making Decisions, Social Governance Becomes Important, Importance of Board/Leadership Governance Skills, Employee Role in Governance, Business Structure and Governance, Democratic Aspects of Governance.\n3.4. Innovation Innovation was found in nearly every reference and cited almost 3,000 times. It is clear that innovation is important and the factors upon which it is dependent sheds light on how the mindset of innovation is fostered throughout the company. The literature provided some significant information on innovation, how it is fostered and its results: Establishing a Culture of Innovation (and Sustainability), Provide Models of Personal Innovation, Eliminating Obstacles to Innovation, Creating Initiatives that Support Innovation, HR Incentives for Creativity and Innovation, Discussions Surrounding Climate for Innovation, Demonstrate the Power of Innovation.\n3.5. Leadership Leadership was also mentioned over 1,000 times and in nearly all sources. The importance of leadership was not limited to the TMT, but was emanated from the top in all cases, then inherent at all levels of most organizations. Actionable ideas and models concerning leadership were discovered throughout the literature. Some of the themes are as follows: Addressing Challenges in Employee Leadership, Designing Jobs and Roles to Incorporate Leadership, Peer Commitment through Leadership, Formal Mentor Plan for Leadership Traits, Policies and Practices for Leadership, Benchmarking Leadership, TMT Leadership, Identifying Leaders.\n3.6. Teamwork Teamwork was an important theme throughout the literature, but the exact word search yielded few results. It was only when the phrase was expanded to include committees, groups and other forms of cooperative engagement did the importance of teamwork become clear. This list was comprised from a review of the exact term \u2018teamwork\u2019 and other similar phrases. Incentives and Pay for Teamwork, Communicating Value of Teamwork, Provide Skill Building for Teamwork, Teamwork and Spirit, Employee Involvement and Training, Structuring of Teams, Participatory Decision-making for Teams, Information Sharing in Teams.\n3.7. Training Training, as an exact reference, was found in nearly every source and was mentioned 4300 times. It is clear that successful EO organizations engage heavily in training and development of employees. Specific accounts of the term training were linked to a rather large number of initiatives, and it was described in numerous ways. Equity Compensation Training, Financial Training, Cross Training, KSA Development through Extensive Training, Formal Training Leading to Responsibility, Education, Certification and Training, Basic Math and English Training, Importance of Onboarding.\n3.8. Transparency Transparency (especially in finance) was cited as extremely important and referenced in a variety of formats, such as open-book management, honesty and integrity. It was cited as important from the TMT down through the entire organization. Transparency was fostered through a variety of methods and its beneficial results were identified throughout the literature. Clear Expectations Concerning Transparency, High Morale through Transparency, Financial Transparency, Transparency and Empowerment, TMT Advocating Transparency, Integrity through Transparency, Citizenship, Community and Transparency, Trust through Transparency.\n4. Discussion Learning can be managed like any other activity. Consider the organization\u2019s existing assets and processes. Is there a strong HR or marketing team that can help develop communications or training programs? Are there teams or committees that might be tasked with disseminating information? While there is no substitute for leadership among the TMT, effective knowledge transfer at all levels will help develop leaders throughout the organization. The extent to which this can be accomplished, will provide the highest dividends of employee ownership. With the methods of knowledge transfer in mind, consider the CSFs in terms of knowledge delivery. Then, take into consideration, the workers\u2019 current level of knowledge on each, along with the method that best transfers added information. In order to simplify the process, use LM principles to group like learners. Learners can be grouped in terms of supervisory level, skill sets, department, team, committee, or country. Of course, there will always be an \u2018all learner\u2019 plan that includes, at minimum, onboarding and orientation, which is a significant factor in creating and maintaining ownership culture. Once learners are grouped, a plan is formed for each set of learners. Recall that knowledge can be transferred in a variety of ways. Ownership culture must be broad-based within the organization to be effective, so at minimum, there will be a mix of learning interventions designed for all learners. This is similar to the functioning of a learning management system (LMS) that is commonly found in universities, associations and larger organizations (Whitcomb Citation2016).\n4.1. Unique knowledge requirements Given the variables of what knowledge might need to be transferred based on current resources and practices, it is prudent to organize learners so progress can be tracked in clear and measurable terms. Broad examples of CSFs are assigned to learning groups along with a method of transferring knowledge for each. Since every industry is different this will vary significantly from one organization to the next, as the literature suggests. The following categories can be used to represent groupings of like learners. When considering what must be learned, and how this knowledge transfer will occur, it will be essential to keep in mind the best method for uniform delivery to these groups of learners. These groups will be assigned \u2018learning plans\u2019 for the purposes of exposing employees to ownership according to the CSFs discovered and outlined above.\n4.1.1. All employees Depending on the size of the company, most employees already receive orientation, compliance training, timekeeping material, benefits education and other onboarding information.\n4.1.2. Top management team (TMT) In addition to assuming responsibility for overall communication and strategy concerning the transformation program, the TMT must become intimately familiar with the messages, training and forms of communication expected of each member.\n4.1.3. Client teams Professional services firms often have procedures surrounding client interactions. EO organizations typically have improved client service.\n4.1.4. Subject matter experts These groups of like learners need uniform knowledge throughout the organization regardless of their geographic location \u2013 like safety officers on project sites, logisticians, IT technicians, project managers etc.\n4.1.5. Divisions Divisions may share similar overall policies but have very different learning requirements. These divisions might share the same values, but have very different operating procedures.\n4.1.6. Job categories and description It is very common for organizations to require certain skill sets for certain jobs and levels. These competencies can be taken right from a good job description, and these in turn are updated to reflect the new responsibilities workers take when gaining ownership.\n4.1.7. Number of employee reports First time supervisors might need training in communication protocol in addition to perhaps financial literacy. Directors and VPs need different types of training. However, everyone engaged in interviewing, hiring and firing at all levels might require the same training. It is not uncommon for organizations to begin to offer leadership and other developmental training to those supervising others. When you begin to evaluate groups of learners in terms of what must be learned and how it will occur, your opportunities increase significantly. Evaluating all these combinations for feasibility, reliability and growth, provides a foundation for a sound workplace development strategy. One general strategy found in the literature was the use of committees for various purposes. These groups, both formal and informal, were used to plan and dissipate knowledge at all levels, and for a variety of groups. Ideas were tested in committees and then deployed. For the purpose of this research, we will take the \u2018all employee\u2019 category, and begin to apply the CSFs and the methods of knowledge transfer (Argote et al. Citation2000). For instance, signage concerning the new status of all employees as owners, can be displayed both in hard copy, as signs in the workplace, and digitally on the company intranet. Communication will start from the TMT and move through the organization in the form of articles, emails, meetings and informal conversations. A formal communication plan is not uncommon during the planning phase of transition to employee ownership. All employees will be exposed to ownership through new orientation training, which will become used for onboarding new employees in the future. Financial literacy communication, and perhaps training, will be offered to supervisors and client teams that have fiscal responsibility.\n5. Conclusion and opportunities for additional research Critical Success Factors (CSFs) are useful for gaining insight into what needs to be accomplished to gain maximum benefit of EO. The information gained in the literature was from mature organizations that instilled the culture over years of fine tuning. Companies hired consultants on occasion, but others had dynamic leaders who created the vision for the future. CSFs are used to mitigate risk, and selling to employees can be risky if profitability takes a downturn. Employees can see ownership as a risk rather than an opportunity, and knowledge helps reduce these risks. Many employees do not have the understanding to contribute towards the bottom line, until they receive training. In mature EO companies, human resources (HR) practices are honed to include sourcing, and training, people who are a good fit for EO. The purpose of this research, however, is to provide a path for companies to gain the benefits of EO, so risks will be reduced.\n5.1. Second and third phases of CSF research To further cull the CSFs into action items, the second and third phases of CSF research should be undertaken. In the second phase, members of management who have first-hand experience in the cultural and operational aspects of developing EO culture should be interviewed. This is known as a qualitative phenomenological study, as these people have \u2018experienced the phenomenon\u2019 of transforming an organization into ownership. The steps they took, and the importance of each CSF in the process, are documented and coded for similarities. During this phase, the CSFs are also ranked in order of importance and assigned to groups, or teams who are responsible for managing the process. Finally, dependencies are determined. For instance, an excellent onboarding program may not be possible without a strong HR department. Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study is to determine if extended\u2010release, bioabsorbable, subcutaneous naltrexone (NTX) implants can mitigate respiratory depression after an intravenous injection (IV) of fentanyl. Six different BIOabsorbable Polymeric Implant Naltrexone (BIOPIN) formulations, comprising combinations of Poly\u2010d,l\u2010Lactic Acid (PDLLA) and/or Polycaprolactone (PCL\u20101 or PCL\u20102), were used to create subcutaneous implants. Both placebo and naltrexone implants were implanted subcutaneously in male dogs. The active naltrexone implants consisted of two doses, 644\u2009mg and 1288\u2009mg. A challenge with IV fentanyl was performed in 33 male dogs at 97\u2013100\u2009days after implantation. Following the administration of a 30\u2009\u03bcg/kg intravenous fentanyl dose, the placebo cohort manifested a swift and profound respiratory depression with a ~50% reduction in their pre\u2010dose respiratory rate (RR). The BIOPIN NTX\u2010implanted dogs were exposed to escalating doses of intravenous fentanyl (30\u2009\u03bcg/kg, 60\u2009\u03bcg/kg, 90\u2009\u03bcg/kg, and 120\u2009\u03bcg/kg). In contrast, the dogs implanted with the BIOPIN naltrexone implants tolerated doses up to 60\u2009\u03bcg/kg without significant respiratory depression (<50%) but had severe respiratory depression with fentanyl doses of 90\u2009\u03bcg/kg and especially at 120\u2009\u03bcg/kg. Bioabsorbable, extended\u2010release BIOPIN naltrexone implants are effective in mitigating fentanyl\u2010induced respiratory depression in male canines at about 3\u2009months after implantation. This technology may also have potential for mitigating fentanyl\u2010induced respiratory depression in humans.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nHealth behaviors established during college years are typically carried on into adulthood; however, many college students are not meeting physical activity guidelines. In addition, sociodemographic and environmental factors impact exercise motivation and physical activity; yet, only limited research has compared motivations and behaviors between different student groups. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare exercise motivation and physical activity among college students. In this quantitative cross-sectional survey study, a volunteer sample of 307 undergraduate students (75.2% White, 68.7% Female) enrolled in health and fitness courses at a Mid-Atlantic region United States University and Community College completed an online demographic questionnaire, International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), and Behavioral Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-3). A series of independent samples t-tests were conducted to compare relative autonomy index (RAI) and subscale scores (obtained via the BREQ-3), as well as physical activity scores (MET-minutes/week obtained via the IPAQ-SF). Statistically significant differences in exercise motivation and physical activity were found based on student age, housing status, major/program of study, and gender identity. In an effort to reduce health disparities, university administrators and coordinators are advised to keep these considerations in mind when developing physical activity policies and programs for college students.\n\nKEYWORDS: Physical activity, exercise motivation, college students\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nWhy do rebel groups fragment during peace negotiations? The defection of the Karuna Group from Sri Lanka\u2019s LTTE during the 2002\u20132006 peace process served as the case study to investigate this research question. The disagreement between LTTE leader Prabhakaran and Karuna was the immediate cause of the split. The negotiation disagreement stemmed from the decision to explore federalism as a solution to the conflict. There were supporting factors that boosted the negotiation disagreement. Karuna\u2019s pro-peace transformation, his insecurities, the differences between the Northern and Eastern Tamils, and the external influence enhanced and consolidated the negotiation disagreement.\n\nGraphical Abstract\nDisplay full size\n\nKEYWORDS: Civil war, peace negotiation, rebel fragmentation, Sri Lanka, LTTE\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nNotes\n1.

        "abstract": "Multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating across different currencies are exposed to exchange rate risk. They may utilize a variety of tools to mitigate that risk. While there are different types of exchange rate risk, this study focuses specifically on the ongoing exposure of cash flow transactions denominated in the currencies of seven different developed countries. Since other types of risk (i.e., economic and translation) are evaluated based on yearly results, they are not considered in this study. Themodifiedvalue-at-risk (MVaR) model is employed to estimate the maximum one-period losses during the eighteen months before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and, in addition, the maximum one-period losses during the eighteen months following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The predicted losses using MVaR are then compared with the actual ex-post results. Our objective is to analyze the extent of the cash flow transaction exposure and provide practical insights to MNEs as they decide whether or not they should hedge this risk. This study is noteworthy because it compares the pre- and post-COVID-19 periods.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nEthics is largely dominated by European curriculum which includes Western moral theories such as deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and care ethics. To decenter this dominant ethics curriculum, the present phenomenological study explored the moral lived experience of ethics for Korean Buddhist (male and female) monastics (N = 21). Using three-level qualitative coding, data were thematically analyzed. Findings revealed three overarching themes (1) the importance of the sa\u1e45gha and community care, (2) the presence of ethical tensions, and (3) ethics as a practice. Each theme had two sub-themes. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of how these insights from the lived experience of Buddhist ethics may inform and advance social work ethics education beyond the Eurocentric curriculum.\n\nKEYWORDS: Decenter, ethics, lived experience, Buddhism, social work\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nNotes\n1. In other words, Therav\u0101da is an Abhidharma tradition (the only one still in existence today), and Zen is a Mah\u0101y\u0101na tradition.\n2. In Sanskrit, an\u0101tman (see Buswell & Lopez, Citation2014).\n3. Per Harvey (Citation2000), vinaya are rules.\n4. Per Buswell and Lopez (Citation2014), \u015b\u012bla refers to ethical behavior (right speech, right action, right livelihood).\n5. Per Harvey (Citation2000), Bhikkhu and Bhikkhun\u012b are the P\u0101li words for monk and nun.\n6. Per Buswell and Lopez (Citation2014), this is a Buddhist hybrid Sanskrit word. It is also referred to as sa\u1e45gha (p. 750). Sa\u1e45gha is a \u2018P\u0101li and Sanskrit variation of community\u2019 (p. 768).\n7. An\u0101tman replaces our traditional notion of the \u2018person\u2019 as a composite of five parts (skandhas): material (r\u016bpa), feeling/sensation (vedan\u0101), perception (sa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101), mental activity/volition (sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra), and consciousness (vij\u00f1\u0101na).\n\nBuswell, R.

The quantum cohomology ring QH*(IG) has negative structure constants. For n\u22653, we give a positivity condition that implies the quantum cohomology ring QH*(IG) is the only quantum deformation of the cohomology ring H*(IG) up to the scaling of the quantum parameter. This is a modification of a conjecture by Fulton. Keywords: Positivity, quantum deformation, quantum cohomology 2020 MATHEMATICS SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION: Primary: 14N35 Secondary: 14N15 14M15 Acknowledgments I would like to thank an anonymous referee for identifying a gap in the argument for the |\u03bb|>2n case. I would also like to thank Leonardo Mihalcea for a very useful conversation.\n",

        "abstract": "Background:Palpitations are the second most common presenting symptom for cardiology visits. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders in patients with symptoms of arrhythmia, palpitations, is well documented but how this compares to patients at the greatest risk for major cardiac arrythmia is unknown.\n\nObjectives:The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of anxiety or depression in patients with symptomatic palpitations vs patients at risk for major cardiac arrhythmia (congestive heart failure) and further evaluate the effects on their quality of life using the SF-36 assessment tool.\n\nMethods:Patients with palpitations (50 subjects) or prior ICD (50 subjects) were given the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).\n\nResults:There was an insignificant trend for increased anxiety, with a mean GAD-7 score in palpitations group of 4.14 vs 3.04 in CHF group with anxiety prevalence in 40% palpitations and 28% of ICD patients. The mean score of PHQ-9 in palpitations group is 4.84 vs 4.96 in CHF group with 38% of the palpitation group having depression compared to 44% of the ICD group. The SF-36 physical function domain showed that the palpitations group was more functional than the ICD group with a mean score of 0.709 in palpitations group vs 0.513 in CHF group (P <0.05.) Subjective frequency of palpitations had a mean of 3.47 in the palpitation group vs 1.5 in the CHF group with P<0.05.\n\nConclusions:Patients presenting with symptomatic palpitations have more symptoms of anxiety than patients at risk for major arrythmia, but have less functional limitations than the ICD group, as expected. There is a non-significant trend to more anxiety in the palpitations group, but both groups are far above populations norms of 2-4%. Depression is not different between the groups but both groups are far above the population averages of 5-6%. Patients with palpitations have fewer physical limitations but have at least an equal amount of anxiety and depression as a far more ill group of patients. It is a standard of care to treat symptomatic palpitations due to PVCs with beta blockers; this will not help symptoms of anxiety and it may worsen depression. When seeing patients presenting with palpitations, or patients with chronic heart disease and an ICD, we should consider an evaluation for anxiety and depression.\n",

        "abstract": "Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) traditionally has been used in research concerning prospective and practicing classroom teachers. This essay argues that PCK is also relevant to other professions including those advancing quantitative reasoning (QR). To illustrate, the case of PCK for teaching QR is considered. Those in fields such as public health, journalism, meteorology, and government increasingly find themselves responsible for helping the public understand an ever-growing amount of quantitative information that has a bearing on societal well-being. Several examples illustrate how such professionals\u2019 responsibilities require knowing prevalent QR patterns in society, strategies for fostering sound reasoning, and the general nature of school curricula. Professional organizations in education, colleges of education, and educational researchers would benefit from expanding PCK research to encompass multiple professions. These expanded research and development efforts would simultaneously address urgent societal needs.\n",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the synoptic conditions associated with lake-effect snow (LES) over northwestern Pennsylvania with a focus on classifying cases based on the tracks of cyclones influencing the region, including Nor\u2019easters (NEs), Alberta Clippers (ACs), Colorado Lows (COs), and Great Lakes Lows (GLs). Synoptic composites were constructed using the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) for all cases, as well as each cyclone group, using an LES repository spanning from 2006\u20132020. Additionally, 95 percent bootstrapped confidence intervals were created for each cyclone track to compare the initial mesoscale environmental properties (i.e., surface lake/air temperature and wind direction/speed) and LES impact (i.e., duration, maximum snowfall, and property damage). Synoptic composites of all LES cases exhibited an archetypal LES synoptic pattern consisting of an upper-level low geopotential height anomaly over the Hudson Bay and surface dipole structure centered across the Great Lakes basin. Regarding the different tracks, NEs and COs featured dynamic support in the form of enhanced turbulent mixing and synoptic vertical forcing, while ACs and GLs had greater thermodynamic support in the form of higher lapse rates and heightened heat and moisture fluxes. However, the bootstrapping analysis revealed minimal differences in LES impact between the cyclone types.\n",

        "abstract": "This article revolves around two soundtracks Walker has admired along with the person to whom this issue of Alphaville is dedicated: Danijela Kulezic-Wilson. The soundtracks come from Soul by Pete Docter and Kemp Powers and Nomadland by Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, both released in 2020. The films are sonically worlds apart: Soul is dominated by jazz music by Jon Batiste and contemporary electronic music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, while Nomadland features modern classical music by Ludovico Einaudi and \u00d3lafur Arnalds. Ironically, despite sounding profoundly different, both films draw from true stories in order to teach audioviewers about living well, even in the midst of death. Or, to reapply Danijela\u2019s words about Waking Life (Richard Linklater, 2001), these films emphasise \u201cthe dualistic nature of human experience, the pleasure of being alive and the implicit proximity of death.\u201d Walker combines cinematherapy with sound studies to make a case for the wisdom of both films that have helped her cope with the grief of Danijela\u2019s death, in the hope that this might resonate for those readers who find similar comfort in their own film-to-person relationships.\n",

        "abstract": "This exploratory study sought to address the gap in strengthening science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teacher preparation in elementary and secondary teacher education programs. Integrated STEM education is attracting increased attention and gaining momentum from educators, politicians, STEM industries, and the media across the nation. Many state and national organizations have called for a new workforce of problem solvers, innovators, and inventors who are self\u2010reliant and able to think logically, also suggesting that creating such capacity is one of the critical foundations that drive innovative capacity in the nation. A key to developing these skills is STEM competencies and career goals in every K\u201012 student. To do this, teachers must be educated on how to connect STEM careers and integrate STEM content into their curriculum. Providing integrated STEM micro\u2010credentials for preservice and in\u2010service teachers can be a flexible solution for providing teachers a method to learn how to improve their content knowledge and pedagogy (Digital Promise, 2019). Participants were a combination of undergraduate preservice teachers and graduate early\u2010career teachers who were asked about their STEM preparation. The majority of the participants received very little to no integrated STEM preparation. As a possible solution for this, participants were asked about their preferred type of professional development (PD) and if participating in a micro\u2010credential course would be a possibility. Nearly all of the participants agreed that a self\u2010paced micro\u2010credential that blended online and in\u2010person instruction would be something they would do to learn how to integrate STEM more effectively into their pedagogy. Micro\u2010credentials could be a successful solution for educator PD.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMulticultural Feminist Mentoring (MFM) models have provided an important foundation to address the further need for conceptualizing a mentoring model that is specific to Asian/Asian American (A/AA) experiences. In this collaborative autoethnography, six researchers in three mentor-mentee dyads explored what it means to pursue Asian/Asian American feminist mentoring (A/AAFM), through dyadic and group interactive dialogues and collaborative analysis. A/AAFM can be conceptualized as anti-racist praxis, where each mentor attempted to consider mentoring as activism within academia, being grounded in values stemming from A/AA experiences and feminism. Results yielded a model of A/AAFM which emphasizes a convergence of multifaceted racial and cultural identities, feminist values, and activism. Three specific processes emerged: being holistic, relational, and mutual; a focus on community and intergenerational generosity; and intentional flattening of the power hierarchy. Implications for training and activism are discussed.\n\nKeywords: Activism, Asian, Asian American, feminism, mentoring\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nNotes\n1. In this paper we utilize the terminology Asian/Asian American (A/AA), with the recognition that there are numerous terms to refer to people of Asian descent in the US. We chose this terminology given the composition of our research group (i.e., individuals who identify as Asian and/or Asian American) who generated the mentoring model, and in order to include experiences of Asian international students. In addition, we did not use the term Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) in order to honor the unique experiences of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations, whose experiences we do not capture in this study.\n2. In this paper, we utilize the terminology mentee to refer to individuals who may be more junior in experience and training in a mentoring relationship. When describing other scholars\u2019 contributions, we have reported the terminology used by the scholars that may be different from mentees (e.g., prot\u00e9g\u00e9s).\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nSolutions journalism is one of the newest alternative journalism strategies aimed at combating news fatigue through rigorous reporting on solutions to society's problems. One of the primary goals for the movement is increased source diversity that features more non-official and citizen voices, like those often used in other forms of alternative media. This study examined the types of sources journalists included in 555 text-based solutions journalism articles from the U.S., Europe, and Africa collected from the Solutions Journalism Network. The results indicate solutions stories are meeting the goals set forth by proponents of the movement, as they most frequently include nonprofits/groups and unaffiliated citizens. Solutions stories in American publications contained significantly more non-official sources than did their European and African counterparts, though these sources still comprised the majority of those used across all three continents. However, solutions stories included in the study contained fewer total sources than traditional news articles and still featured government and business sources regularly. This finding suggests solutions journalism practitioners may still have work to do to increase their use and variety of sources.\n\nKEYWORDS: Solutions journalism, source diversity, content analysis, alternative media, official sources, elite sources, unofficial sources, citizen sources.\n\nDisclosure Statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n",

        "abstract": "## Abstract\nIn this paper, we use the well-documented mutual fund flow-performance relationship to infer information about investors\u2019 preferences. We show that applying preference parameter values from experimental settings to market data can significantly understate the role of prospect theory in explaining investor behavior. We find evidence that mutual fund investors exhibit loss aversion and differential attitudes toward risk over losses (risk-seeking) and gains (risk-averse) but no significant probability weighting when evaluating fund performance. Our results apply more strongly to retail funds compared to institutional funds, consistent with the view that prospect theory is more relevant for retail investors. Finally, we show that, for parameter values that best explain fund flows, prospect theory outperforms the global risk aversion framework and widely-used asset pricing models in explaining investors\u2019 responses to fund performance.\n\n**Keywords**: G11, G23, G40, loss aversion, mutual fund flows, prospect theory, reference-dependent preferences.\n\n**Disclosure statement**: No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n",

        "abstract": "Corporate social responsibility has received much attention regarding how it can benefit firms and why firms voluntarily address social issues. However, little is known about the problems to which firms choose to pay attention and what influences these decisions. We combine the attention\u2010based view of the firm and media agenda\u2010setting theories to propose that firms address the most prominent social issues as determined by the media. We analyze the frequency of 64 social issues in the CSR reports of 258 firms from 2006 to 2016 for a total sample of 86,208 issue\u2010firm\u2010year observations. We find that the salience of the problems in traditional media influences the social issues firms address in their CSR reports, and over time, the agenda\u2010setting effect of traditional media on firms has increased, solidifying traditional media's role as curators of social issues.\n",

One prevailing perspective (Barnett, Henriques & Husted, 2020; Barnett, Henriques & Husted, 2024) is that digital media leads to slacktivism, a token display of support, which impedes the ability of stakeholders to act collectively and makes it easier for firms to dismiss stakeholder claims. Another perspective (Colleoni, Zyglidopoulos & Illia, 2024) argues that even though synchronicity may be difficult to achieve, digital media in the form of hashtags makes it easier for heterogeneous stakeholders to converge around a broader demand for societal change and indirectly pressure firms to change their policies and practices. In this exchange, we expand on Colleoni, Zyglidopoulos, and Illia\u2019s (2024) arguments by encompassing other forms of digital activism beyond generic hashtags. Drawing from the logic of connective action, we argue that two universal pathways\u2014connectivity and velocity\u2014applicable across a wide range of digital activism, are reshaping and enhancing stakeholders\u2019 ability to influence a firm\u2019s social policies and practices.\n\n**REFERENCES**\nBarnett, M.

Estuaries and their corresponding tidal creeks have been impacted by human anthropogenic influences for decades, allowing a variety of restoration practices to be implemented in upland streams. In the face of climate variability and continuous human development pressures, this research performs statistical analysis and a wavelet coherence on, before, and after stream restoration for water quality changes in Chesapeake Bay\u2019s tidal tributaries in the Lower Western Shore to identify if the restoration strategies have been effective in the mesohaline tidal creeks. Statistical analysis showed that currently, the receiving tidal basins are not seeing the required positive improvements in water quality after years of upland stream restoration. Compounding this is the fact climate variability cannot be ignored. Results indicate that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has significant wavelet coherence with bottom dissolved oxygen, precipitation, and nutrients. This suggests that current restoration efforts may not be able to keep up with climate variability, and other techniques (restoration or policies) may need to be implemented.\n",

        "abstract": "Physical inactivity has been established to be problematic for college students both short- and long-term. Their participation in physical activity (PA) is influenced by many factors which will be explored in this study. The purpose of the study was to examine the interrelationships of PA enjoyment, exercise goal setting, exercise self-efficacy, and recording PA behaviors and the impact on PA. One thousand four hundred and seventy-six students at a public university in the United States responded to a questionnaire consisting of validated survey instruments regarding PA levels and exercise behaviors between 2014 and 2018. Exercise self-efficacy, PA enjoyment and recording PA were direct positive predictors of PA. Our findings reinforce the positive influence between PA enjoyment, exercise self-efficacy, and establishing exercise goals with increased PA. Particularly, exercise goal setting and PA enjoyment not only directly impact PA but also influence other model variables, underscoring their significance in enhancing PA among college students.\n",

        "abstract": "Aim/Purpose: The aim of this paper is to examine Gen Z students located in a representative region of the United States when it comes to technology use, news and information gathering behaviors, civic engagement, and social concerns and whether differences exist based on institutional type. The purpose is to report this information so that academics can better understand the behaviors, priorities, and interests of current American students.\n\nBackground: This paper investigates the mindset of Generation Z students living in the United States during a period of heightened civic unrest. Through the lens of the Theory of Generations, Uses and Gratifications Theory, and Intersectional Theory, this study aims to examine the Gen Z group and compare findings across populations.\n\nMethodology: An electronic survey was administered to students from 2019 through 2022. The survey included a combination of multiple responses, Likert scaled, dichotomous, open-ended, and ordinal questions. It was developed in the Survey Monkey system and reviewed by content and methodological experts to examine bias, vagueness, or potential semantic problems. The survey was pilot-tested in 2018 before implementation in order to explore the efficacy of the research methodology. It was then modified accordingly before widespread distribution to potential participants. The surveys were administered to students enrolled in classes taught by the authors, all of whom are educators. Participation was voluntary, optional, and anonymous. \n\nContribution: This paper provides insight into the mindset of Generation Z students living in the United States, which is helpful to members of academia who should be informed about the current generation of students in higher education. Studying Generation Z helps us understand the future and can provide insight into the shifting needs and expectations of society.\n\nFindings: According to the findings, Gen Z are heavy users of digital technologies who use social media as their primary source for gathering news about current events as well as information for schoolwork. The majority of respondents considered themselves to be social activists. When institutional type was considered, there were notable differences with the students at the Historically Black College or University (HBCU), noting the greatest concern with a number of pressing issues, including racial justice/Black Lives Matter, women\u2019s rights, gun violence, immigration reform, and human trafficking. Less significance across groups was found when LGBTQIA+ rights and climate change were considered.\n\nRecommendation for Researchers: As social media continues to proliferate in daily life and become a vital means of news and information gathering, additional studies such as the one presented here are needed. In other countries facing similarly turbulent times, measuring student interest, awareness, and engagement is highly informative.\n\nFuture Research: Future research will explore the role that influencers have in opinion formation and the information-gathering habits of Gen Z.\n",

        "abstract": "Little is known about the motivational factors or design features that might lead female career and technical education (CTE) health sciences students to persist in self-regulated engagement to win state achievement in serious simulation games (SSGs). In this study, 12thgrade female CTE health sciences students played a 3-Level hand hygiene SSG that was developed based on a learner analysis of a prior cohort of students. A within-subjects repeated measures design was used to assess differences in student motivation using a 10-construct Value-Achievement-Cost\n (VAC) Survey between baseline and the time they exited the SSG. Student choice to persistently engage in each level of the SSG was also evaluated using a 10-item SSG design feature score board. The average time that the Level III achievement students were engaged in the SSG was twice as long\n as Level I/II achievement students. Three of the 4 perceived mean Cost construct scores significantly decreased with large effect from baseline for students who persisted to the SSG Level III win state while all pre-post Value and Achievement orientation constructs scores remained unchanged.\n Mean average differences were not statistically significant for any of the ten core SSG design elements regardless of engagement time.\n",

        "abstract": "Feeding morphology permits animals to adapt to changing environments and is often under strong selection. We evaluated if bill shape varies according to differences in dietary prey taken across geographical ranges (North America, Central America, South America, and Caribbean islands) in a ubiquitous, New World raptor species, the American kestrel (Falco sparverius). Specifically, we predicted that bills in geographies where kestrels consumed a larger proportion of vertebrates would be shorter and wider, with a larger tomial tooth. We reviewed the literature on kestrel diets across their range and quantified potential differences in bill shape using geometric morphometric methods for 245 museum specimens. The literature review revealed that most prey consumed by kestrels in North, South, and Central America were invertebrates (51.6\u201369.1%), whereas Caribbean kestrels consumed mostly vertebrates (61.4%), most of which were reptiles (77.3%). Morphometric analyses agreed with these findings; bill shape differed for island versus mainland kestrels but not among mainland regions. Bill shape on islands reflected a more robust bill with a larger tomial tooth, but had a longer hook, which we suggest is adaptive for consumption of lizard prey, more available on islands due to reduced competition with other raptors compared to mainland regions.\n",

        "abstract": "## Abstract\n**Objective** To understand college students\u2019 perceptions and understanding of wellness.\n\n**Participants** A convenience sample of 20 undergraduate students (age 20.6 \u00b1 2.2 years) at a private liberal arts university in Southern California who recently completed a general education health and wellness course.\n\n**Method** Five focus group sessions were conducted to explore perceptions of wellness among undergraduate college students. Data was analyzed, themed, and coded.\n\n**Results** A thematic analysis of the descriptions of wellness revealed 2 higher-ordered themes as whole-person and wellbeing, and 3 lower-ordered themes of balance, interconnectedness, and personalized in relation to participants\u2019 understanding of wellness.\n\n**Conclusions** The importance of balance between wellness dimensions and the acknowledgment of the interconnectedness of wellness dimensions are related to quality of life and life satisfaction. A deeper insight is needed to better understand the perceptions of wellness in this population to provide more effective interventions. This can be achieved through the development of enhanced pedagogy, which may improve student health.\n\n**Keywords:** Perceptions, wellness, emerging adults, college students, general education course\n\n**Conflict of interest disclosure** The authors have no conflicts of interest to report. The authors confirm that the research presented in this article met the ethical guidelines, including adherence to the legal requirements, of United States of America and received approval from the Institutional Review Board of Point Loma Nazarene University (IRB # 18230), and participants provided informed consent.\n\n**Additional information**\n\n**Funding** The author(s) reported there is no funding associated with the work featured in this article.\n",

        "abstract": "We study whether the quality of the first job is lower for professional Asian nationals than for non-Asian nationals in the USA. With over a million professionals from Asia entering the US labor market in the past decade, a potential under placement may be both inefficient and discriminatory. We collected data on all newly hired assistant professors of management in research-intensive (R1) universities in the USA between 2010 and 2021. We focus on the quality of the university into which first hires are placed and examine whether first-job placement quality is lower for individuals who were born in East, South and Southeast Asia. We find that the quality and quantity of publication record are positively related to the quality of the placement and that Asian nationals have higher performance. However, Asian nationals are placed at lower-quality universities relative to their peers. Further, Asian nationals require a strong performance signal, in the form of first or second authorship on a publication to narrow the placement gap. Our results are explained by a combination of direct bias against applicants of Asian nationality and a requirement of a higher performance \u201cburden of proof\u201d from these applicants, compared to peers who are non-Asian nationals.\n",

        "abstract": "This study examined perceptions of and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic among 489 faculty from four public universities in the southeast United States. Data were collected via an online survey during the Fall 2020 semester, when campuses re-opened after closing in March. Two thirds of faculty perceived the severity of COVID-19 as severe, and their greatest concerns related to preventive behaviors, the possibility of a virus resurgence, and concern for the health of family/friends. The majority reported frequently engaging in COVID-19-preventing behaviors, which was highest among female and older faculty, and those with higher perceived severity and concern for personally contracting the virus. Over half of respondents reported teaching and scholarly activities were negatively impacted by the pandemic; most notable barriers to productivity included anxiety/stress and a distracted home environment. The study adds to the research on university faculty during the pandemic and aligns with research on the adult population.\n",

        "abstract": "Background:Bicycling is a healthy form of physical activity that can be performed by most adults as part of leisure-time (LT) activity. However, little is known about LT bicycling behaviors, especially in the rural areas of the United States. This study sought to contrast the prevalence and factors associated with LT bicycling in populations living in urban settings with those living in rural settings.Methods:The 2019 Behavior Risk Factor Survey, which contains information regarding LT physical activity behaviors among adults (N\u2009=\u2009396,261) in the United States, was used to determine the prevalence, demographic profile, and likelihood of meeting the physical activity guidelines of LT bicyclists. The 2013 National Center for Health Statistics Urban/Rural Classification Scheme was used to classify respondents living in rural and urban settings.Results:Among US adults, 3.8% (95% CI, 3.7\u20133.9) reported LT bicycling activity, the sixth most common physical activity. Adults living in urban counties compared with rural counties had a greater prevalence of LT bicycling (3.9% vs 2.3%, respectively), with adults living in rural counties having a 34% lower probability of LT bicycling. Rural bicycling prevalence rates were lower across all demographics. Urban bicyclists, compared with rural bicyclists, cycled more months of the year. Overall, 85.5% of all bicyclists met the aerobic physical guidelines, with no differences between urban and rural bicyclists.Conclusions:Bicycling remains an important LT physical activity among adults in the United States. However, a rural\u2013urban difference in the prevalence does exist for LT bicycling. The reasons for this disparity warrant further investigation.\n",

        "abstract": "## Objective:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic placed extreme burden on hospitals, while opioid overdose is another challenging public health issue. This study aimed to examine the trends and outcomes of opioid overdose hospitalizations in Pennsylvania during 2018 to 2021.\n\n## Design:\nWe identified opioid overdose hospitalizations in the state of Pennsylvania using the state-wide hospital discharge database (PHC4) 2018 to 2021. We examined the number of opioid overdose hospitalizations, the corresponding mortality and discharges against medical advice comparing the pre-COVID period (2018-2019) and the COVID period (2020-2021). We also assessed what patient and hospital characteristics were associated with in-hospital death or leaving against medical advice.\n\n## Results:\nA total of 13\u2009446 opioid-related hospitalizations were identified in 2018 to 2021. Compared to pre-pandemic, a higher percentage of cases involving synthetics (17.0%vs 10.3%, P\u2009<\u2009.0001) were observed during COVID. After controlling for covariates, there was no significant difference in opioid overdose in-hospital deaths in the years 2020 to 2021 compared to 2018 to 2019 (OR\u2009=\u20090.846, 95% CI: 0.71-1.01, P\u2009=\u2009.065). The COVID period was significantly associated with more leaving against medical advice compared to years 2018 to 2019 (OR\u2009=\u20091.265, 95% CI: 1.11-1.44, P\u2009=\u2009.0003). Compared to commercial insurance, Medicaid insurance was associated with higher odds of both in-hospital death (OR\u2009=\u20091.383, 95% CI: 1.06-1.81, P\u2009=\u2009.0176) and leaving against medical advice (OR\u2009=\u20091.903, 95% CI: 1.56-2.33, P\u2009<\u2009.0001).\n\n## Conclusion:\nThere were no substantial changes in the number of overall opioid overdose cases and deaths at hospitals following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania. This observation suggests that an increased number of patients may have succumbed to overdoses outside of hospital settings, possibly due to a higher severity of overdoses. Further, we found that patients were more likely to leave against medical advice during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThis study investigated the effect of limb occlusion pressure (LOP) position on exercise performance, cardiovascular responses, and perceptual experiences during seated bilateral leg extensions with and without blood flow restriction (BFR). Thirty resistance-trained males (age: 22 \u00b1 2 years; weight: 74.4 \u00b1 13.6 kg; height: 177.4 \u00b1 6.4 cm; BMI: 23.5 \u00b1 3.3 kg/m2) participated. Each performed exercise to failure (4 sets, 30% 1RM, 1 min rest) in three conditions: Supine LOP-BFR, Seated LOP-BFR, and no-BFR. BFR was applied at 60% LOP. Significant interaction effects were found for RPE (p = 0.021, d = 0.76), RPD (p < 0.01, d = 1.72), and DOMS (p < 0.01, d = 2.28). Statistically significant fewer repetitions were completed in Supine LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.5), Seated LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 1.0), and Seated LOP-BFR vs. Supine LOP-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.6). RPE was higher in Seated LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.52). RPD was higher in Supine LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.62) and Seated LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 1.25). DOMS was higher in Supine LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 0.77) and Seated LOP-BFR vs. no-BFR (p < 0.01, d = 3.52). Seated LOP-BFR increased perceptual demands and reduced repetitions compared to Supine LOP-BFR. Both LOP-BFR conditions reduced repetitions compared to no-BFR without affecting cardiovascular measures.\n\nKEYWORDS: Blood flow restriction, resistance training, arterial occlusion pressure, occlusion training\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank the participants for volunteering their time and effort for the study.\n\nDisclosure statement\nNicholas Rolnick is the founder of the BFR PROS and teaches BFR training workshops to fitness and rehabilitation professionals using a variety of BFR training devices.\n\nData availability statement\nData is available upon reasonable request by contacting the corresponding author.\n\nAdditional information\nFunding\nThe author(s) reported there is no funding associated with the work featured in this article.\n",

        "abstract": "## Premise:\nSphagnum magellanicum(Sphagnaceae, Bryophyta) has been considered to be a single semi\u2010cosmopolitan species, but recent molecular analyses have shown that it comprises a complex of at least seven reciprocally monophyletic groups, that are difficult or impossible to distinguish morphologically.\n\n## Methods:\nNewly developed barcode markers and RADseq analyses were used to identify species among 808 samples from 119 sites. Molecular approaches were used to assess the geographic ranges of four North American species, the frequency at which they occur sympatrically, and ecological differentiation among them. Microhabitats were classified with regard to hydrology and shade. Hierarchical modelling of species communities was used to assess climate variation among the species. Climate niches were projected back to 22,000 years BP to assess the likelihood that the North American species had sympatric ranges during the late Pleistocene.\n\n## Results:\nThe species exhibited parallel morphological variation, making them extremely difficult to distinguish phenotypically. Two to three species frequently co\u2010occurred within peatlands. They had broadly overlapping microhabitat and climate niches. Barcode\u2010 versus RADseq\u2010based identifications were in conflict for 6% of the samples and always involvedS. diabolicumvs.S. magniae.\n\n## Conclusions:\nThese species co\u2010occur within peatlands at scales that could permit interbreeding, yet they remain largely distinct genetically and phylogenetically. The four cryptic species exhibited distinct geographic and ecological patterns. Conflicting identifications from barcode vs. RADseq analyses forS. diabolicumversusS. magniaecould reflect incomplete speciation or hybridization. They comprise a valuable study system for additional work on climate adaptation.\n",

        "abstract": "Recognizing food types through sensor signals for unseen users remains remarkably challenging, despite extensive recent studies. The efficacy of prior machine learning techniques is dwarfed by giant variations of data collected from multiple participants, partly because users have varied chewing habits and wear sensor devices in various manners. This work treats the problem as an instance of the domain adaptation problem, where each user represents a domain. We develop the first multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) method for food-typing recognition, which consists of three major components: stratified normalization, a multi-source domain adaptor, and adaptive ensemble learning. New techniques are developed for each component. Using a real-world dataset comprised of 15 participants, we demonstrate that our method achieves\\(1.33\\times\\)to\\(2.13\\times\\)improvement in accuracy compared with nine state-of-the-art MSDA baselines. Additionally, we perform an in-depth ablation study to examine the behavior of each component and confirm their efficacy.\n",
