        "abstract": "Rape experience is common and victim empathy may help address it (e.g., prevention, victim support). We examined rape victim empathy based on type of rape experience (none, incapacitated, forcible, combined). Undergraduate women ( n\u2009=\u2009658) completed the Rape Victim Empathy-During Subscale and Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization. Rape experience was associated with greater empathy, especially for those with any forcible experience. Perhaps due to weaker memory of their own rape event, incapacitated victims may be relatively less able than forcible victims to understand another victim's perspective during a rape. Researchers should consider examining incapacitated and forcible rape as distinct experiences.\n",

Five domains (challenges, identity, values, relationship, and well-being) and seventeen categories emerged. Participants experienced implicit discrimination and cultural barriers. They identified themselves as Koreans and valued family\u2019s well-being as their priority. They made efforts to find meaning and satisfaction by supporting children to become independent adults. Participants were aware of their traditional parenting styles and the intergenerational cultural gap with their children. As first-generation immigrants, Korean immigrant fathers reported a lack of genuine relationships with both Korean Americans and non-Korean Americans outside of their families. Although participants reported freedom from the pressure caused by interdependent Korean culture, they felt homesickness and emptiness without their own valued life goals.\n",

For the experiment, students prepare a solution of a series of homologous analytes and collect mass spectra of those analytes using GC-MS. All the analytes undergo the same three-step fragmentation in the mass spectrometer. The relative peak intensities from the ions in the fragmentation scheme are plotted as a function of the vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecular ions\u2019 R group. Trends in these plots can be explained using concepts from RRK theory and highlight the \u201cdegrees of freedom effect\u201d in mass spectrometry. The experiment is suitable for a variety of upper-level, undergraduate chemistry laboratories.\n",
