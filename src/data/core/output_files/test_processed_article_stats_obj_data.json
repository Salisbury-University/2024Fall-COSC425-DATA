Investigations into specific behaviors and practices that influence arterial stiffness has been a priority in the past few years. Chronic aerobic and anaerobic exercise activity has consistently shown to attenuate or not influence markers of arterial stiffness in adults with chronic disease and otherwise healthy adults. Chronic high functional resistance training\u2019s effect on vascular compliance is less understood.\nPURPOSE: To determine the effects of a chronic high functional resistance training program on pulse wave velocity and beta-stiffness index.\nMETHODS: Participants (18-40 years old) were placed in a non-randomized fashion into high functional resistance training (HFRT) group (n = 9; >6 months of CrossFit experience; 4 female), or control (CON) group (n = 8; < 6 months of exercise experience; 6 female). Participants in the HFRT group trained at the same local facility 4 -5 days a week, utilizing the same training program. CON group refrained from exercise during the study period. Body composition, 1,000 meter rowing test, deadlift 1 repetition maximum (1 RM), hemodynamic assessments and vascular compliance was assessed at baseline and follow-up. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to examine within and between interactions on indices of arterial stiffness.\nRESULTS: There were baseline differences between groups in deadlift 1 RM (72.3 \u00b1 18.2 kg mean difference (MD), p < 0.01), rowing time (143.8 \u00b1 35.7 sec MD, p < 0.01), and rowing average watts (153.8 \u00b1 34.6 watts MD, p < 0.01). Following the intervention, seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increased only in the CON group (3 \u00b1 4 mmHg MD, p = 0.04). No significant differences within and between group interactions were found in arterial stiffness variables.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate indices of arterial stiffness are not influenced by participation in chronic high functional resistance training.

The impact of this type of training on arterial stiffness is less understood.\n\nPURPOSE: To investigate the acute effects of autoregulated (AR) and non-autoregulated (NAR) BFR exercise on indices of arterial stiffness. AR BFR training devices adjust pressure in the cuff ensuring similar pressure throughout the range of motion when the muscles are contracted (dilatated) and relaxed. NAR BFR training devices do not adjust pressure in the cuff throughout the range of motion when the muscles are contracted and relaxed which cause greater pressures at different points in the range of motion.\n\nMETHODS: Following a randomized AR or NAR familiarization training session, 20 adults (23 \u00b1 5 years; 7 female) participated in 3 randomized treatment-order sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no-BFR separated by 1-week washout periods. Participants performed 4 sets of dumbbell wall squats to failure using 20% of 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) at 2-second concentric/eccentric cadence. Pneumatic straps were placed around the proximal portion of each thigh and training limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both the AT and NAR sessions. Testing before and immediately following the training session included ultrasonography of the carotid artery, applanation tonometry, and blood pressure acquisition. Two-way ANOVAs were used to examine the effects of treatment and the treatment-order interaction on pulse wave velocity (PWV), beta-stiffness index (\u03b2-stiff), and arterial compliance (AC).\n\nRESULTS: There were no baseline differences in CF- (carotid-femoral) PWV, CR- (carotid-radial) PWV, \u03b2-stiff, and AC (all p > 0.05). CF-PWV increased in the NAR-BFR (mean difference = 0.57 \u00b1 1.12 m/s, p = 0.02) and no-BFR (mean difference = 0.63 \u00b1 1.42 m/s, p = 0.03) groups following the exercise session. CR-PWV increased in the no-BFR (mean difference = 0.82 \u00b1 1.5 m/s, p = 0.03) group. And there was an interaction effect in CF-PWV between AR-BFR and NAR-BFR (mean difference = 0.70 \u00b1 1.6 m/s, p = 0.03).\n\nCONCLUSION: These findings show acute AR-BFR training does not influence indices of arterial stiffness while acute NAR-BFR training increases central stiffness.\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 by the American College of Sports Medicine\nView full article text\n",
