    "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>Arterial stiffness has long been regarded as an indicator of disease and is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events. Controversies exist amongst the impact of resistance training protocols on the stiffening process in the major elastic arteries. This study was designed to address some of the controversies.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>PURPOSE</jats:title><jats:p>To determine the vascular impact of a high\u2010volume (HV), moderate resistance training program and a high\u2010intensity (HI), moderate repetition training program on arterial compliance.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>METHODS</jats:title><jats:p>21 otherwise healthy, male university students with limited resistance training experience (&lt; 6 months) were randomized into one of three groups: 7 control (CO) group (22\u00b13 yrs), 6 HI resistance exercise group (23\u00b13 yrs), and 8 HV resistance exercise group (21\u00b13 yrs). All were subjected to a series of tests including anthropometry, ultrasonography of the carotid artery, applanation tonometry, blood pressure acquisition, and maximal strength assessment. Subjects were instructed to maintain normal dietary patterns throughout the study period. Food consumption was monitored. All subjects in the training groups performed the same 8\u201310 exercises on training days. Subjects in the HV group trained at 50\u201370% of 1\u2010RM with 10\u201315 repetitions and 2\u20134 sets per exercise for 3\u20135 days a week for 12 weeks. Subjects in the HI group trained at 70\u201395% of 1\u2010RM with 3\u20136 repetitions and 2\u20133 sets per exercise for 3\u20135 days a week for 12 weeks. Subjects randomized to the control group were instructed to refrain from both cardiovascular and resistance exercise during the study period. Arterial stiffness comparisons were calculated with two\u2010way ANOVA with repeated measures.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>RESULTS</jats:title><jats:p>1\u2010RM significantly increased for squat (52% vs. 25%, p&lt;0.05), bench press (31% vs. 27%, p&lt;0.05) and seated rows (22% vs. 13%, p&lt;0.05) in the HV and HI groups respectively. Carotid femoral PWV did not change in the HI (7.6\u00b12 vs. 8.1\u00b12 m/s, p&gt;0.05), HV (6.3\u00b11 vs. 6.8\u00b12 m/s, p&gt;0.05), and CO (6.7\u00b11 vs. 6.7\u00b11 m/s, p&gt;0.05) groups. Beta stiffness index did not change in the HI (5.9\u00b13.5 vs. 5.7\u00b12.6 U, p&gt;0.05), HV (6.5\u00b11.9 vs. 6.5\u00b12.1 U, p&gt;0.05), and CO (7.2\u00b14.4 vs. 6.4\u00b13.1 m/s, p&gt;0.05) groups.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSION</jats:title><jats:p>12 weeks of HI and HV training does not appear to augment indices for arterial stiffness in young, adult males.</jats:p><jats:p>This abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2018 Meeting.
