    "abstract": "<jats:p>L\u2010Ascorbate is an antioxidant produced by many eukaryotes and is available for microbial organisms in eukaryotic detritus. <jats:italic>Ralstonia eutropha</jats:italic> H16, a soil bacterium that is studied due to its extensive metabolism and bioplastic producing capabilities, can use L\u2010ascorbate via a metabolic pathway that is different from the known pathways of <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> and plants. Transcript levels were measured in L\u2010ascorbate\u2010grown <jats:italic>Ralstonia eutropha</jats:italic> H16 and compared to transcript levels of succinate\u2010 and fructose\u2010grown <jats:italic>Ralstonia eutropha</jats:italic> H16. Genes with a larger than 50\u2010fold upregulation during L\u2010ascorbate growth were investigated. A BLAST search suggested that the proteins encoded by the genes of interest in <jats:italic>Ralstonia eutropha</jats:italic> H16 differ from enzymes of the <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> L\u2010ascorbate metabolic pathway<jats:italic>. Ralstonia eutropha</jats:italic> H16 does not convert L\u2010ascorbate into L\u2010threonate and oxalate, as plants do. Genes of interest, <jats:italic>h16_rs15015</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>h16_rs19815</jats:italic>, were deleted. The resultant mutants do not grow with L\u2010ascorbate. The deletion of specific metabolic genes allows us to better understand their function and importance to the cell's metabolism, furthering our understanding of how different enzymatic metabolic pathways function in nature.</jats:p><jats:p>This abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2019 Meeting.
