    "abstract": "<jats:p>L\u2010Ascorbate (Vitamin C), a primary antioxidant in plants and animals, is an abundant carbon source highly produced by plants so is an available carbon source for soil bacteria. We previously identified a novel L\u2010ascorbate metabolic strategy in <jats:italic>Ralstonia eutropha</jats:italic> H16 (<jats:italic>Cupriavidus necator</jats:italic> ATCC 17699) by eight enzymes up to three transporters; the first enzyme is a membrane bound L\u2010ascorbate oxidoreductase (LaaO). Which face of LaaO, periplasmic or cytoplasmic, is catalytic was investigated by complementation of an <jats:italic>laaO</jats:italic> mutant with a cytoplasmic plant L\u2010ascorbate oxidase. Growth with L\u2010ascorbate of two of the three transporter deletion mutants was impaired but not abolished. The growth defects correlated with concentrations of L\u2010ascorbate or spontaneous degradation products in the media. Transcript levels of each transporter gene, fluorescence of mCherry\u2010transporter fusion mutants, and the L\u2010ascorbate and dehydroascorbate concentrations were monitored to observe the regulation of transporter genes. This work elaborates on environmental carbon cycling by a novel L\u2010ascorbate pathway found in hundreds of bacteria while clarifying transporter function in three different protein families.</jats:p>",
