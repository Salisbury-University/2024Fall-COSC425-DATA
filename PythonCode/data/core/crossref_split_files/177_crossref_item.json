    "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this case study is to provide readers with an authentic experience of working alongside clinical care providers in a hospital environment. This case study walks the reader through the analysis, creation, implementation, and evaluation of a bronchodilator protocol initiative in a respiratory therapy department. Seeing the initiative from foundation to evaluation, the reader will experience the viewpoints, strengths, and weaknesses presented by all team members and stakeholders. By the end of this case study, the reader should be able to describe Kirkpatrick's Model of Evaluation and critique missteps the team took along the way. </jats:p>",
