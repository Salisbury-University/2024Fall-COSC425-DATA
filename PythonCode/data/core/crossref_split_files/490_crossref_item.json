    "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic><jats:bold>Background</jats:bold>:</jats:italic> Bicycling is a healthy form of physical activity that can be performed by most adults as part of leisure-time (LT) activity. However, little is known about LT bicycling behaviors, especially in the rural areas of the United States. This study sought to contrast the prevalence and factors associated with LT bicycling in populations living in urban settings with those living in rural settings. <jats:italic><jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>:</jats:italic> The 2019 Behavior Risk Factor Survey, which contains information regarding LT physical activity behaviors among adults (N\u2009=\u2009396,261) in the United States, was used to determine the prevalence, demographic profile, and likelihood of meeting the physical activity guidelines of LT bicyclists. The 2013 National Center for Health Statistics Urban/Rural Classification Scheme was used to classify respondents living in rural and urban settings. <jats:italic><jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>:</jats:italic> Among US adults, 3.8% (95% CI, 3.7\u20133.9) reported LT bicycling activity, the sixth most common physical activity. Adults living in urban counties compared with rural counties had a greater prevalence of LT bicycling (3.9% vs 2.3%, respectively), with adults living in rural counties having a 34% lower probability of LT bicycling. Rural bicycling prevalence rates were lower across all demographics. Urban bicyclists, compared with rural bicyclists, cycled more months of the year. Overall, 85.5% of all bicyclists met the aerobic physical guidelines, with no differences between urban and rural bicyclists. <jats:italic><jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>:</jats:italic> Bicycling remains an important LT physical activity among adults in the United States. However, a rural\u2013urban difference in the prevalence does exist for LT bicycling. The reasons for this disparity warrant further investigation.</jats:p>",
