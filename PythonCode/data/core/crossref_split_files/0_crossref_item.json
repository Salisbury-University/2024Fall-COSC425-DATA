    "abstract": "<jats:p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in living organisms can generate oxidative stress, which contributes to cell damage associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Studying responses to oxidative stress in model organisms, like the nematode worm <jats:italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</jats:italic>, may provide insight into basic underlying cellular mechanisms shared with humans. MRCK\u20101 (myotonic dystrophy kinase\u2010related Cdc42 binding kinase), a highly conserved intracellular kinase, is activated by the G\u2010protein, Cdc42, which contains a redox sensitive motif. Previous studies have shown that MRCK\u20101 regulates cell polarity and cytoskeleton reorganization, particularly during cell division and in response to cellular damage. To determine if MRCK\u20101 plays a role in other cellular defense responses, we are testing if RNA interference (RNAi) of <jats:italic>mrck\u20101</jats:italic> results in the production of more ROS under stressed conditions. The cell permeable fluorescent ROS indicator, carboxymethyl dichlorodihydrofluorescein derivative, CM\u2010H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>DCFDA, shows significantly increased fluorescence in hydrogen peroxide\u2010treated worms when quantified using the SpectraMax microplate reader. Oxidative stress conditions were induced with hydrogen peroxide (H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) in the presence of CM\u2010H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>DCFDA, and fluorescence was measured over a period of 20 hours. Measuring the fluorescence of worms exposed to dsRNA from two independent <jats:italic>mrck\u20101</jats:italic> RNAi constructs, <jats:italic>mrck\u2010m</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>mrck\u2010s</jats:italic>, enables the quantification of ROS levels when MRCK\u20101 function is decreased. Exploring the levels of ROS in RNAi\u2010treated <jats:italic>C. elegans</jats:italic> may give further insight into the cellular role of MRCK\u20101 both in worms and in humans.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Support or Funding Information</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>Special acknowledgments to the Salisbury University Department of Biological Sciences, the Henson Undergraduate Research Award, and the National Science Foundation MRI Acquisition Award DBI\u20101337534 for support.</jats:p>",
