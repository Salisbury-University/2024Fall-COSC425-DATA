    "abstract": "<jats:p> e13587 </jats:p><jats:p> Background: The lower Eastern Shore of Maryland is an agricultural and rural region with high cancer rates. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine if cancer patients on the lower Eastern Shore utilize higher rates of well water compared to individuals in the general county population. Methods: A retrospective chart review of all cases of colon, lung, melanoma and breast cancer diagnosed at Peninsula Regional Medical Center in 2017 was completed. Demographic and clinical information including family, smoking and prior cancer history, as well as residential water source were recorded. Individuals with residential addresses outside of Wicomico, Worcester and Somerset counties were excluded. Overall well water use for each county was determined using U.S. 2010 census data. Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to compare well water utilization rates in cancer patients and the overall county population. Results: 631 patient cases were reviewed and 384 patients were identified for data analysis. The majority of patients were white (81%), diagnosed with breast cancer (41%), and used well water (52%, n = 209). Cancer patients in the three counties combined were significantly more likely to use well water than individuals in the general county population (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 2.11, 3.16). In Wicomico county, 61% of cancer patients used well water (n = 140). Wicomico cancer patients were more likely to use well water than individuals in the general Wicomico county population (OR = 4.4, 95% CI 3.41, 5.78). No significant findings were observed for patients living in Worcester and Somerset counties. No differences in family, smoking or prior cancer history in patients using well water versus municipal water were identified. Conclusions: Cancer patients on the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland used well water more than municipal water. Cancer patients also utilized higher rates of well water compared to individuals in the general county population. Interpretation is limited by small sample size and lack of causality, however the results signal a need for additional studies evaluating well water use and cancer risk in this region. </jats:p>",
