The 2020 Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education Standards for Professional Athletic Training Programs require students to apply concepts of quality improvement to provide athletic training care and deliver excellent patient outcomes. As such, programs may be looking for strategies to view students' clinical experiences through a lens of quality improvement.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Objective</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>To introduce the Critical Assessment and Reflection on Experience (CARE) form, which is a novel clinical education tool that assesses student clinical skills using critical reflection and quality improvement concepts.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Background</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Historically, students have demonstrated achievement by comparing their skill performance with a competency checklist. Typically, the skills assessed, and the level of achievement expected progress to allow learning over time. However, current athletic training clinical education literature has shifted to promote experiential learning, critical thinking, and active reflection to develop competence.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Description</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Students complete the CARE form after patient encounters or other clinical experiences. The form requires students to practice documentation and communication skills, but also to critically reflect on performance by applying quality improvement, patient safety, and evidence-based practice concepts.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Clinical Advantage(s)</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The form holds advantages for multiple stakeholders, including students, preceptors, and program administrators. The CARE form encourages students to engage in authentic patient interactions rather than relying on contrived learning experiences. By encouraging live patient encounters, this tool results in less burden on preceptors to create additional opportunities for students. Program administrators can use the tool to incorporate quality improvement standards meaningfully into the curriculum. Additionally, the CARE form creates opportunity to document program assessment.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion(s)</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Professional programs should consider implementing the CARE form as a clinical experience assessment tool to develop students' quality improvement and critical thinking skills when providing athletic training services.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",
