    "abstract": "<jats:p>Reassembly, curated by G Douglas Barrett and Petros Touloudi\nTinos, Greece\n5 July 2017 to 31 October 2017</jats:p><jats:p>\nThe free movement of bodies and objects once considered critical for the\nsmooth functioning of contemporary art has appeared, especially since 2017,\nincreasingly uncertain in this era marked by new forms of nationalism, xenophobia,\nand economic isolationism. Indeed, many artists working in this\nenvironment have found it difficult or impossible to cross once unquestionably\nopen borders, or to ship works to and from exhibitions held across a requisitely\ninternational stage. As an attempt to respond to this crisis, I, along\nwith Petros Touloudis, curated Reassembly, an exhibition held in the summer\nof 2017 on the island of Tinos, Greece. The exhibition came out of an annual\nresidency program organized by Touloudis\u2019s Tinos Quarry Platform and was\nheld at the Cultural Foundation of Tinos. Overall, we wanted to ask if there is\na critical role for music can play in the field contemporary art, especially as its\nplagued by new forms of border policing and geopolitical conflict.</jats:p>",
