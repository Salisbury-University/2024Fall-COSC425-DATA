    "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:title>Objective</jats:title><jats:p>To determine the effects of acute creatine monohydrate supplementation on arterial stiffness (AS) and skeletal muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2). There is a void in our knowledge on the impact of acute creatine monohydrate supplementation on AS in the major elastic arteries. In addition, there is a dearth of findings on the effects of creatine supplementation on SmO2 in the lower leg. Data have indicated that creatine supplementation can result in an increase in lower leg anterior compartment pressure at rest and post exercise. Although the increased pressures seen during these studies were not pathological, this and additional factors associated with creatine supplementation could possibly effect SmO2 during exercise and recovery.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>20 male, physically active participants were randomized in a double\u2010blind fashion to placebo (PL) (n=10, 22.9\u00b13.1 yrs.) or creatine (CM) (n=10, 21.3\u00b11.8 yrs.) groups. Subjects received 0.3 g/kg/day creatine monohydrate or placebo in gelatin capsules for 7 days. Ultrasonography of the carotid artery, applanation tonometry, submaximal exercise tests (10 minute treadmill activity at 3.7 mph and 9% incline), SmO2, and lower leg pain (analog visual scale and pain test algometer) assessments were conducted at baseline and on day 7 of the study period.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>There were baseline differences in central systolic blood pressure (cSBP) (mean difference, 109; 95% confidence interval (CI) 105 to 113, vs. mean difference, 130; 95% CI 114 to 146, p &lt; 0.05) between the PLA and CM groups, respectively. Following the intervention, there were no significant differences between PL and CM in arterial stiffness indices between the groups. There was a significant group effect (P&lt;0.03) but no significant effect of supplementation (P&gt;0.05) on the % change in SmO2 during the exercise tests (CM: pre 66.49 \u00b1 30.54; post 59.61 \u00b1 23.87 vs. PL: pre 39.87 \u00b1 16.72; post 38.51 \u00b1 26.95 % change SmO2; M \u00b1 SD). Percent fat free mass (FFM) was significantly increased (mean, 68.5\u00b17.5%; 95% CI 62.1% to 72.9%, to mean 69.3\u00b17.5% 95% CI 62.9% to 73.6%, P&lt;0.05) in the CM group only. There were no other significant changes in anthropometric measurements.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>Using a randomly controlled, double\u2010blind trial with validated measurements of AS and SmO2, acute creatine supplementation does not appear to impact vascular compliance or oxygen saturation in skeletal muscle in young, healthy males.</jats:p></jats:sec>",
