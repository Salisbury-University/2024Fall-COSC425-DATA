    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article revolves around two soundtracks Walker has admired along with the person to whom this issue of Alphaville is dedicated: Danijela Kulezic-Wilson. The soundtracks come from Soul by Pete Docter and Kemp Powers and Nomadland by Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, both released in 2020. The films are sonically worlds apart: Soul is dominated by jazz music by Jon Batiste and contemporary electronic music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, while Nomadland features modern classical music by Ludovico Einaudi and \u00d3lafur Arnalds. Ironically, despite sounding profoundly different, both films draw from true stories in order to teach audioviewers about living well, even in the midst of death. Or, to reapply Danijela\u2019s words about Waking Life (Richard Linklater, 2001), these films emphasise \u201cthe dualistic nature of human experience, the pleasure of being alive and the implicit proximity of death.\u201d Walker combines cinematherapy with sound studies to make a case for the wisdom of both films that have helped her cope with the grief of Danijela\u2019s death, in the hope that this might resonate for those readers who find similar comfort in their own film-to-person relationships.</jats:p>",
