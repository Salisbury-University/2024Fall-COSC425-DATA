    "abstract": "<jats:p>Many parasites, including hookworms of the genus <jats:italic>Ancylostoma</jats:italic>, are specialists and require host\u2010specific signals to resume development upon infection. Although little is known about the nature of these signaling molecules, evolutionary conservation between hookworms and the model nematode <jats:italic>C. elegans</jats:italic> suggests that hookworm host\u2010signal receptors are likely to be G\u2010protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are expressed in amphid neurons. Based on bioinformatic analysis of developmental stage\u2010specific RNA\u2010Seq data from <jats:italic>A. caninum</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>A. ceylanicum</jats:italic>, predicted hookworm GPCRs with increased expression levels during the infective larval stage 3 (iL3) were identified.</jats:p><jats:p>Approximately 1500 bp of genomic sequence upstream of the predicted start site for the putative <jats:italic>A. ceylanicum</jats:italic> GPCRs were fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence to generate promoter\u2010GFP transcriptional fusion constructs, which were microinjected into <jats:italic>C. elegans</jats:italic>. Of nine hookworm promoter fusions tested, four drove differential GFP expression in <jats:italic>C. elegans</jats:italic> tissues, including the digestive tract, pharynx, and a neuron pair. Preliminary analysis identified the neurons as interneurons, potentially involved in locomotion responses to chemosensory input in <jats:italic>C. elegans</jats:italic>. The putative GPCR encoded by the neuronally expressed gene is upregulated in both <jats:italic>A. ceylanicum</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>A. caninum</jats:italic>, suggesting that it may play a general role in hookworm development during host infection. These experiments indicate that hookworm promoters can be expressed in <jats:italic>C. elegans</jats:italic>, providing a surrogate system for the study of hookworm gene expression patterns.</jats:p><jats:p>This abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2018 Meeting.
