Eastern Red-backed Salamanders, *Plethodon cinereus*, are often used as indicators of habitat quality in eastern North American forests. Most of the research concerning growth in this species has focused on the influence of body size, rather than on other external or temporal factors that might affect growth. We performed a mark\u2013recapture study spanning multiple years and seasons to compare the growth of individuals of *P. cinereus* across temporally variable environmental conditions. Unsurprisingly, the most significant factor affecting growth was body size. Growth also varied seasonally and annually, with greater growth of salamanders during a mild winter and more growth in 2014 than 2013. Sex-age class did interact with yearly fluctuations as evidenced by juveniles, but not adults, having reduced growth in 2014. However, color morph did not have an effect on growth. We concluded that fluctuating environmental conditions, as well as body size, exerted effects on the salamanders' growth. This study adds to our understanding of the factors affecting growth in terrestrial salamanders and provides context for past and future studies of body size and abundance in this ecologically important species.",

Undergraduate men (n = 385) completed the Rape-Perpetrator Empathy Scale (Smith and Frieze 2003) and the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Perpetration (Koss et al. 2007), which first asks behavior-based questions, without using the word \u201crape,\u201d to identify rapists and those with other sexual perpetration experience, and then asks if they \u201cmay have ever raped someone.\u201d None of the respondents admitted to \u201crape,\u201d but participants whose survey responses indicated prior behavior consistent with rape (rapists) reported greater empathy than those who indicated no behaviors consistent with any type of sexual perpetration (nonperpetrators). Respondents who indicated prior behavior consistent with sexual perpetration, but not rape (nonrape perpetrators) did not differ from either rapists or nonperpetrators. Committing rape may be associated with greater rape perpetrator empathy due to similarity in experience.",

Despite an ethical mandate to advocate for social and economic justice, there is a retrenching emphasis on macro practice within social work education. This circumstance affects the profession\u2019s commitment to human rights and social justice as social work students are often unable to actively engage in change-making activities. Many students graduate without the knowledge and skills needed to enact systemic change in their agencies, communities, states, or nation. This case study will explore the use of experiential learning methods to challenge carceral power through the demonstration of macro practice skills, which are essential for challenging the status quo of practices and policies that sustain oppressive systems. This case study details the organization and facilitation of \u2018Know Your Rights\u2019 (KYR) trainings, which educate community members about their Constitutional rights when confronted by the police. Through a successful collaboration between the American Civil Liberties Union, a social work program, and a dozen community organizations, the KYR trainings, conducted by over 60 BSW students engaged in three macro practice courses, were delivered in a rural community on the east coast with nearly 400 community members and students in attendance.</p>\n</div>\n```",

Adolescent and young adults, including college students, are especially unlikely to seek professional help for mental illness. This issue presents a concern, because signs and symptoms commonly appear during this part of growth and development. <b>Purpose</b>: The Health Belief Model (HBM) was used to explore perceptions about mental illness and mental health service utilization and self-medication among college students who may or may not have a history of mental illness. <b>Methods</b>: A survey exploring HBM constructs and self-medicating behaviors was distributed to a population of university undergraduate students ages 18\u201324. A concurrent focus group of mental health care providers investigated practitioner perceptions of mental health care utilization. Results of both were analyzed for common themes. <b>Results</b>: Sociocultural concerns and challenges navigating through the system were the primary perceived barriers to accessing mental health services. Primary care providers were reported as a vital cue to action. Alcohol, marijuana, and prescription medications were the most frequent and preferred substances used for self-medication. <b>Translation to Health Education Practice</b>: The most apparent theme is the need for education and continuing school partnerships. Doing so can offer diagnosis and treatment and foster personal and social skill development.</p>\n</div>\n```",

In order to take full advantage of these data sources, it is helpful to have a strong analytic lens to orient one's reflections on the data. One promising analytic lens is the National Research Council's five stands of mathematical proficiency framework. It prompts teachers to examine the extent to which their students have attained conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, strategic competence, adaptive reasoning, and productive dispositions. This article describes how a pair of prospective teachers used the five strands to analyze and reflect upon qualitative classroom data from a series of lessons they taught. The insights gained during the process can help others anticipate dynamics involved in using the five strands framework during practitioner research and reflection on classroom data.",

Over the course of a long and successful career, however, quality physical education teachers must continue to adapt to the changing demands of their profession. The professional growth that results in the development of quality physical education teachers begins with their entry into the undergraduate professional education program, continues with their initial employment, and matures over the course of their professional career. Physical education teacher education programs provide experiences that lay the foundation for continued professional development and learning over the span of a professional teaching career. The purpose of this article is to share a descriptive model of sequential professional growth and examples of developmental activities that can be integrated into a teacher education program to facilitate this growth. The professional growth and development activities are described within the context of the following four stages: (1) awareness stage, (2) exploration stage, (3) connection stage, and (4) professional stage. Suggestions for developing a professional \u201croad map\u201d for charting the activities completed by candidates over the course of their undergraduate education are also presented with a list of suggested activities.\n\n---",

The analysis occurred during a multi-year project aimed at prompting communities to adopt clean indoor air policies. The results showed that most editorials were about tobacco restrictions or ordinances, were neutral in tone, and provided factual information about tobacco control. More editorials were negatively slanted vs. positively slanted toward tobacco control. Most editorials with positive tones were published in newspapers in towns that already had clean indoor air policies. We concluded that editorials might hold increased weight in spurring change, as the percentage of smokers in a city is unrelated to the town enacting a clean indoor air ordinance.\n```",

However, the choice among competing vendors that offer the same economic incentives is unclear. Relationship trade-offs and asymmetric power between retailers and vendors may influence these decisions, such that future economic incentives, social incentives, and power asymmetry are likely decision-making factors. Using commitment theory and an experimental design, this study determines that calculative commitment, power asymmetry, and various forms of loyalty commitment have significant decision-making impacts. With greater power asymmetry, calculative commitment exerts a stronger impact than comprehensive loyalty commitment; in low power asymmetry conditions, comprehensive loyalty commitment has more impact.\""
