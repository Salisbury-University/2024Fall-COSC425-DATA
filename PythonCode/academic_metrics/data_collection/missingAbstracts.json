Eastern Red-backed Salamanders, *Plethodon cinereus*, are often used as indicators of habitat quality in eastern North American forests. Most of the research concerning growth in this species has focused on the influence of body size, rather than on other external or temporal factors that might affect growth. We performed a mark\u2013recapture study spanning multiple years and seasons to compare the growth of individuals of *P. cinereus* across temporally variable environmental conditions. Unsurprisingly, the most significant factor affecting growth was body size. Growth also varied seasonally and annually, with greater growth of salamanders during a mild winter and more growth in 2014 than 2013. Sex-age class did interact with yearly fluctuations as evidenced by juveniles, but not adults, having reduced growth in 2014. However, color morph did not have an effect on growth. We concluded that fluctuating environmental conditions, as well as body size, exerted effects on the salamanders' growth. This study adds to our understanding of the factors affecting growth in terrestrial salamanders and provides context for past and future studies of body size and abundance in this ecologically important species.",

Older adults\u2019 responses were slower than younger adults\u2019 and associative recognition responses were slower than item recognition. However, for accuracy, there were no differences between age group or test type (item vs. associative), contrary to the expectations of the associate deficit hypothesis. Analysis of the EEG recordings indicated that, at parietal electrode sites, peak amplitudes were significantly larger in response to the associative recognition test compared to the item recognition test. Additionally, a significant 3-way interaction was observed at electrode Cz. The item recognition task elicited larger peak amplitudes to new test items compared to old test items in both age groups. Interestingly, while the associate recognition test also elicited larger peak amplitudes to new and rearranged test pairs as compared to old test pairs in younger adults, this difference did not exist for older adults. Implications for memory training of older adults will be discussed.",
    "10.1670/16-185": "The abstract extracted from the provided HTML is as follows:\n\n\"Color polymorphism is common in many species, and color morph frequency is affected by differences in ecological and evolutionary pressures on each color morph. Plethodon cinereus, the Red-Backed Salamander, has two common color morphs, striped and unstriped, that vary in frequency among populations. Plethodon cinereus color morphs differ in their escape behaviors when exposed to predators and in their tail autotomization rates; this may result from differential predation. Although these previous studies indirectly implicated differential predation, we directly tested the hypothesis that color morphs differed in survival and whether one morph was depredated at a higher rate. We determined the survival of each color morph over 3 yr with the use of mark\u2013recapture data. We first compared frequencies of color morphs in juveniles and adults, and then estimated whether color morphs had different survival rates with the statistical program MARK. We found that frequency of striped salamanders was lower in adults than in juveniles, implying that fewer striped individuals survived to adulthood. In addition, color and age best explained survival probability during spring, but not fall, seasons. To test the effects of color morph on predation experimentally, we used clay models to determine the effects of avian and mammalian predators. We found more attacks on striped clay models by avian predators compared to the unstriped models, but we found no difference in attacks by mammals. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that there is differential predation in P. cinereus, with more predation on, and lower survival in, the striped morph.\"",

Natural history observations and published data are equivocal on whether frosted elfin caterpillars pupate below or above the soil surface, and some evidence suggests that pupation sites differ for caterpillars that feed on lupine (Lupinus spp.) versus wild indigo (Baptisia spp.). Pupation site has important implications for management because pupae located beneath the soil surface will likely be afforded greater protection from fire than those above the soil surface. Our study of both lupine- and indigo-feeding larvae at a single site in Worcester County, Maryland, found that pupation occurs above the soil surface in the leaf litter 92% of the time, and does not differ significantly with food plant preference. We recommend that land managers using prescribed fire as a habitat management tool for frosted elfin habitat assume some level of pupal mortality in burned areas and utilize a rotational burn schedule that maintains areas of unburned refugia in high-density elfin areas. We also recommend that managers try to establish a metapopulation structure for frosted elfin to address the possibility of natural occurring fires.\"",
    "10.1093/ahr/rhy562": "Recent studies on Muslim Spain, or al-Andalus, are continuing the trend away from exceptionalist approaches and moving toward approaches that situate Andalusi history within larger cultural and geographical contexts. Jessica A. Coope\u2019s *The Most Noble of People: Religious, Ethnic, and Gender Identity in Muslim Spain* is a welcome addition to this \u201clarger-than-al-Andalus\u201d approach, alongside works like Janina M. Safran\u2019s *Defining Boundaries in al-Andalus: Muslims, Christians, and Jews in Islamic Iberia* (2013) and Brian Catlos\u2019s *Kingdoms of Faith: A New History of Islamic Spain* (2018); all of these are examples of this trend, as they examine Andalusi history against the backdrop of developments in North Africa, the Islamic East, and the Mediterranean at large.\n\nIn *The Most Noble of People*, Coope studies the tensions surrounding religious, ethnic, and gender identities during the Umayyad period\u2014that is, from the mid-eighth century to the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate and the beginning of the Taifa period in 1031.\n\nThe title of Coope\u2019s book is a reference to a verse from the Qur\u02be\u0101n (49:13), in which God is said to prefer the noblest people among his creation, regardless of ethnicity\u2014a verse that some medieval commentators took to mean that Arab lineage alone did not make someone worthier in the eyes of God. This distinction between Arab and non-Arab Muslims lies at the center of Coope\u2019s analysis.\n\nShe argues that during this period, the Umayyad elite articulated an identity for themselves that conflated Arab with Muslim identity, to the exclusion of the non-Arab majority population over which they ruled. And while the terms of exclusion would have seemed rigid enough\u2014if you were not an Arab Muslim you could not be a member of the elite\u2014Coope contends that Arab identity was relative and negotiable.\n\nTo claim Muslim identity required conversion, unless one\u2019s father were a Muslim, in which case the person in question would also be legally considered a Muslim. To claim Arab identity required more ingenuity. Coope identifies two main strategies to do so: through one\u2019s lineage, and through one\u2019s proficiency in Arabic language and literature. Barring a credible claim to Arab descent (and fabricated genealogies were not unknown), mastery of Arabic language and literature conferred what Coope calls an \u201chonorary Arab identity\u201d to certain Iberian Muslims.\n\nBy the mid-tenth century, and as more and more of the Andalusi population converted to Islam\u2014and here Coope follows Richard W. Bulliet\u2019s \u201cconversion curve\u201d in *Conversion to Islam in the Medieval Period: An Essay in Quantitative History* (1979)\u2014Muslim identity became less contentious. Similarly, and despite the political fragmentation of the Taifa period, Coope argues that, at least from the viewpoint of identity, whether or not one was an Arab ceased to be a matter of consequence.\n\nFor Coope, then, the tensions surrounding religious and ethnic identity were \u201cresolved\u201d with the downfall of the Umayyads. Yet gender identity followed a different path. By examining Islamic and Visigothic legal texts, Coope posits the pros and cons of conversion to Islam for Christian women. While the laws contained similar marriage provisions (viz., dower was necessary and remained in the wife\u2019s control, a woman\u2019s father had the power to arrange marriage, and there was a waiting period to remarry), in the realms of inheritance and public modesty, Muslim status represented a step down. \n\nIn an interesting comparison, Coope argues that the overall diminished legal status of Muslim women was similar to the status of non-Muslims, or *dhimm\u012bs*. Conversion would make it possible for a free man to become a fully capable agent in shari\u02bfa. The same was not the case for women, which leads the author to conclude that tensions surrounding gender identity continued after 1031.\n\nCoope\u2019s examination of gender identity alongside religious, ethnic, and cultural identity is commendable, although available sources dealing with gender identity are not only more limited but also lack direct accounts by women. In addition to well-known legal, polemical, and literary texts\u2014and the prolific Ibn \u1e24azm occupies a central place in Coope\u2019s analysis\u2014the author taps another valuable, less-utilized resource: mystical writings. The work of the influential Sufi writer Ibn \u02bfArab\u012b, who died in 1240 and therefore postdates the period in question, reveals a view of the masculine and feminine genders that is more complementary than the one prescribed by shari\u02bfa.\n\nCoope classifies sources between what we may call \u201cideological\u201d sources (legal, polemical, literary, mystical texts) and sources that, as she puts it, reflect \u201cactual treatment\u201d of Muslim women; however, this classification is misleading. The handful of collections of notarial formulas, fatwas, and shari\u02bfa lawsuits that have survived opens up avenues of inquiry both exciting and challenging. A model of a marriage contract found in Ibn al-\u02bfA\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101r\u2019s notarial formulary contains stipulations that effectively limited the range of prerogatives that shari\u02bfa prescribed for husbands, including the right to take a second wife or to move place of residence without consent. \n\nCoope\u2019s analysis of the volatile relationships between Umayyad rulers and several prominent non-Arab families is one of the most fascinating parts of the book. The case studies on the Ban\u016b Dh\u012b al-N\u016bn, \u02bfUmar ibn \u1e24af\u1e63\u016bn\u2019s family, and the Ban\u016b Qas\u012b are rich, vivid in their portrayal, and illustrate, in a way that prescriptive sources can only do obliquely, the complexity of studying identity.\n\nIn general, Coope\u2019s treatment of the sources is evenhanded; she reviews the pitfalls of every text in a clear, informative manner, and she translates most Arabic words into English and explains the uses and meanings of a few of the most important concepts. This is a readable volume that will be of interest to those studying identity in premodern multicultural contexts and could potentially be assigned to advanced students.",

Her book joins a number of recent publications, such as those by Jasmine Nichole Cobb, Darcy Grimaldo Grigsby, and coeditors John Stauffer, Zoe Trodd, and Celeste-Marie Bernier, which have increased our understanding of images\u2019 political and cultural influence during the nineteenth century. Cutter writes against the notion that images denied enslaved people different modes of agency. Instead, as she demonstrates in five chronological chapters, images conveyed enslaved people\u2019s resistance and rejected ways of seeing that primarily cast them as abject Others.\n\nThroughout her book, Cutter studies numerous methods by which illustrated texts ideally encouraged their readers/viewers toward what she terms *parallel empathy*, a form of \u201cempathy that asserts concordance between a viewing reader and the enslaved\u201d (xi). This guiding concept frames her analysis of book illustrations, cartoons, pamphlets, household wares, and contemporary art pieces. Indeed, one of the strengths of Cutter\u2019s book is the reproduction and examination of more than one hundred images. The resulting collection of images both highlights Cutter\u2019s extensive research and provides an archive of images that scholars can draw on for future research. Weaving together the theories and practice of visual studies, literary studies, graphic narrative studies, sentimental aesthetics, and affect theory, Cutter poses a question that she answers throughout her book: \u201c[H]ow do words and images used together interpellate a reader, ask, demand, or entreat that he or she enter the ideology of the text and of the antislavery movement?\u201d (21).",

It encompasses an area of 1064 hectares consisting of mixed deciduous/coniferous forest habitat within the coastal bay watershed, and has dry uplands and low-lying wetlands that are periodically flooded (Maryland Department of Natural Resources 2016b). From the 1940s to the 1960s the E. A. Vaughn WMA was a game farm for pheasant, and wildlife biologists experimented with plants and plant arrangements to attract and benefit wildlife (Maryland Department of Natural Resources 2016b). Today this area attracts an abundance of megafauna, yet little is known about the insect diversity at the site.\n\nOnly one study has been conducted on insect diversity at the E. A. Vaughn WMA. Mann et al.

They found overlap in diversity between the two sampled habitats with a total richness of 24 ant species. These authors also reported higher abundances of ants foraging on deciduous over coniferous trees. Considering the diversity of ant biology, it seems reasonable to explore more habitats and collecting methodologies at the site.\n\nWe conducted a follow up study to determine any difference in ant species richness at E. A. Vaughn WMA. Bait studies are important because they are an effective way to observe recruit-foraging and dominant species (Anderson 1997) as well as species richness and composition, however, they are often biased towards generalists (Underwood and Fisher 2006). Our objectives were to: 1) determine if there are any additional species to add to Mann et al.

We detected significant declines for Ovenbirds in both datasets, but we found conflicting data for Worm-eating Warblers. During 2012\u20132015, we investigated the effects of forest characteristics, such as vegetative composition and ground cover, on occupancy and nest success. Ovenbirds were found more where there were more and larger trees but were negatively affected by the proportion of pines, whereas Worm-eating Warblers were more abundant when there were higher numbers of trees and more pines. Nest success was not affected by vegetation other than the proportion of pine trees or leaf litter depth, both of which increased nest success. Worm-eating Warblers with more pine needles in their nests also had increased nest success. This study presents a nuanced view of how forest composition (proportion of pine trees) of the Atlantic Coastal Plain in Maryland influenced ground-nesting warblers differently, and suggests that effectively managing ground-nesting warblers in this area may differ from other regions of Eastern North America due to its unique vegetative composition, structure, and history.",

Impressively rich historical context enlivens the neighborhoods, populations, and venues that helped sustain a lively and contentious theater scene. Sustaining the rivalries between Anglophone and Francophone populations was a shifting desire to preserve the French language and colonial cultures and to increase pressure on developing American and Louisianan identities. In Creole Drama, Juliane Braun successfully demonstrates that her study \u201creintegrates non-English-speaking societies and their cultural production into the field of American literary and cultural studies\u201d (p. 7). In this endeavor, she aligns herself with scholars such as Lawrence A. Rosenwald and Werner Sollors while also providing a bridge between the scholarship on New Orleans and early American theater by scholars including Shirley Thompson, Jeffrey Richards, and Heather S. Nathans.\n\nThe book begins by highlighting the deep connections between New Orleans and the French Caribbean. Spanish colonial officials noticed the strong community created by the movement of actors, singers, musicians, and dramatic productions to New Orleans. As a result, the Spanish colonial administration censored the Francophone New Orleans theater because it fostered revolutionary ideas and celebrated French empirical bonds. When Anglophone theaters later competed for dominance in the Crescent City, Francophone theater's references to French empirical cultures became one strategy for cultural survival. Black theater later survived by sidestepping an 1830 censorship law and staged plays that likely critiqued the system of pla\u00e7age and the leadership of Haitian president Jean-Pierre Boyer, though stronger evidence would prove this. Braun's analysis of the Crescent City's free black population's engagement with Latin American emigration is convincing. The vivid context that surveys the effects of the Haitian Revolution (1791\u20131804) and the changing New Orleans neighborhoods shines in the book. The fourth, and perhaps strongest, chapter examines French speakers\u2019 claims to American national identity as the U.S. government pushed for war with Mexico. The theater, Braun argues, became a site to claim American belonging and renounce the history and alleged threat of monarchy. Here, theater's engagement with struggles between groups from different linguistic, cultural, racial, and birthplace backgrounds coalesce skillfully. The book ends with the playwright Victor S\u00e9jour's engagement in debates over slavery, emancipation, and the status of free black people in the Atlantic world. This adds to the book's theme of cultural exchange and intervention by showing that he \u201cevaluated the lessons [of] prior emancipations in Haiti, France, and the British West Indies\u201d in his cultural production (p. 153).\n\nWithin the text, Braun points to potential avenues of scholarly research, though a few could be added. Strong is the case for \u201cstruggles over political and cultural sovereignty\u201d reflected in playhouses, but how did the playhouses, in turn, affect these struggles (p. 9)? This multidirectional flow of cause and effect would deeply enrich this study. Additionally, a fuller investigation of the plays\u2019 reception would help reveal the effects of theater. The unexplained disappearance of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Marigny would enhance this study, as would more evidence that \u201cIndian populations escaped the official racial gaze\u201d in New Orleans is needed (p. 101).\n\nBraun's study of cultural exchanges and interventions smartly incorporates the contributions of non-Anglophone groups into the larger body of American literary and cultural studies. It widens and extends the path for other researchers in these areas.",

    "10.1893/bios-d-18-00029": "Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification of proteins that plays an essential role in many cellular processes. Ubiquitination involves the attachment of the small polypeptide ubiquitin to target proteins to control their activity or stability. As a reversible modification, E3 ubiquitin-ligases attach ubiquitin to proteins while deubiquitinases (DUBs) remove ubiquitin from tagged proteins. Revealing the mechanisms that regulate ubiquitination/deubiquitination is important for understanding how cells fine-tune protein activity to control important processes and pathways. It is clear in animals and yeast that WD-repeat proteins (WDR) bind to and activate DUBs. In plants, however, no interactions between WDR proteins and DUBs have been reported. Here, we used BLAST searches to identify plant homolog proteins of a conserved animal DUB and its associated WDR proteins. Based on these homologies, we predicted that Arabidopsis UBP3, a DUB involved in pollen development and transmission, forms a complex with the WDR proteins At2g37160 and LRS1. Indeed, these three proteins could be co-immunoprecipitated when transiently co-expressed as epitope-tagged proteins in plant cells.

Using 200-m transects and dung-baited pitfall traps, we compared the dung beetle communities on 19 cattle farms in Maryland, USA where pests and/or parasites were controlled with chemicals (CU, n = 9 farms) or where no chemicals were used (NCU, n = 10 farms). Traps were baited once a month with fresh cattle dung from each location. We collected a total of 31 species comprising 12,380 dung beetle specimens. The five most abundant species, Onthophagus taurus (Schreber), Onthophagus pennsylvanicus Harold, Onthophagus hecate (Panzer), Blackburneus stercorosus (Melsheimer), and Labarrus pseudolividus (Balthasar), accounted for 85% of the total individuals sampled. No difference was found when comparing total abundances of dung beetles sampled from NCU and CU farms. There was, however, a consistent significant effect of month across multiple dominant species. Using Random Forests analyses, we determined site location, soil type, and chemical lethality as additional important predictor variables affecting dung beetle abundances on Maryland farms. Present-day management practices implement a broad spectrum of chemical usage. Our work examines this variability to facilitate the understanding of factors currently affecting the biodiversity and abundance of beneficial dung beetles.",

SIT is a time-efficient strategy to improve aerobic performance similar to moderate intensity continuous training (MICT). There has been a relative absence of studies on neuromuscular adaptations of SIT.\n\n**PURPOSE:** To compare the effects of stationary air biking, utilizing high-volume MICT and low-volume SIT (i.e., ultrashort-SIT [US], short-SIT [SS]) on neuromuscular system.\n\n**METHODS:** Thirty recreationally active females were randomly assigned to MICT (n = 10), US (n = 10), and SS (n = 10) groups. The intervention consisted of 3 d/wk for 4 wks. MICT was performed by 30 min of cycling at 75% of maximal heart rate reserve, while SIT (i.e., US, SS) consisted of 3 sets of 8 intervals at maximal effort intensity. SS and US were performed with 20s:10s and 10s:5s work-to-rest ratios and provided with 5- and 2.5-min recovery periods between sets, respectively. Muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) and echo intensity (EI) of rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL) were measured by ultrasound system. Isometric strength testing protocol consisted of 3 maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC). During each contraction, surface electromyography (sEMG) and torque signals were recorded to assess sEMG amplitude (RMS) of RF and VL as well as peak torque (PT). All variables were measured before and after intervention and were analyzed with 2-way mixed factorial ANOVAs. Moreover, average total work (TW) during 12 sessions was recorded and analyzed with one-way ANOVA.\n\n**RESULTS:** There were significant (p < 0.05) differences in TW (MICT: 142.7 \u00b1 31.5 cal., US: 52.6 \u00b1 10.0 cal., SS: 92.3 \u00b1 7.8 cal.) between groups. All groups significantly (p < 0.05) improved mCSA of RF (MICT: 9.0 \u00b1 1.0 to 9.5 \u00b1 1.1 cm\u00b2, US: 9.9 \u00b1 3.5 to 10.6 \u00b1 3.6 cm\u00b2, SS: 9.0 \u00b1 1.9 to 9.7 \u00b1 1.5 cm\u00b2) and VL (MICT: 20.0 \u00b1 2.3 to 20.6 \u00b1 2.1 cm\u00b2, US: 20.8 \u00b1 5.1 to 22.5 \u00b1 5.2 cm\u00b2, SS: 19.6 \u00b1 2.6 to 21.4 \u00b1 3.8 cm\u00b2). No significant (p > 0.05) differences observed in EI values as well as RMS and PT during MVIC.\n\n**CONCLUSION:** Despite no significant improvements in neural activation and isometric strength, all groups similarly improved muscular morphology of RF and VL by performing SIT on a stationary air bike. These findings suggest that SIT can elicit muscular morphological adaptations with a shorter time commitment.",
    "10.1093/melus/mlab052": "Drew Lopenzina\u2019s *The Routledge Introduction to Native American Literature* offers a solid stepping-stone for approaching the reading and teaching of Native American literature. Grounded in decolonizing reading practices and pedagogies, the book brings into relief the major challenges readers face when reading Native texts: how to recognize and challenge reading assumptions based on colonial logics and how to learn about Native epistemologies as the basis for our interpretation of literary texts. To address this challenge, Lopenzina argues for positioning readers in Native spaces, a reorientation of perspective that moves them from a Western-centric standpoint to one shaped by Indigenous epistemologies.\n\nThe book is structured chronologically to guide readers through the development of Native writing from the seventeenth century to the present. Lopenzina takes readers on a journey that starts with Caleb Cheeshateaumauk\u2019s letter to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England in 1663, written in Latin, and ends with Louise Erdrich\u2019s *Round House*, winner of the National Book Award for Fiction in 2012. Starting with the analysis of early texts, oral traditions, and various media of record-keeping and storytelling (such as winter counts and birchbark scrolls), Lopenzina then turns to the emerging Native voices of the New Republic and the Progressive Era. After discussing early twentieth-century novels and what critics call \u201cthe homing plots\u201d of the Native American Renaissance (referring to the journey home framework many novels follow), Lopenzina ends with contemporary fiction, both poetry and prose. In doing so, he examines a body of literature firmly set in Native space by writers no longer including Indigenous epistemologies in their writing but rather *using them* as their conceptual foundation. In this way, he maps out a history of Native American letters, providing compelling literary analysis that puts the texts in conversation with their sociopolitical contexts. At the same time, he offers a crash course in American Indian studies by centering Native critics and mapping out key issues in the field, such as debates around nationhood, literary nationalism, intellectual sovereignty, and literary representation. Overall, the book walks the walk: it teaches by example as it gives ample entry points into a field of study, providing the necessary resources for readers to learn about the texts and their contexts as they work on decolonizing their critical perspectives.",

    "10.1093/ahr/rhab329": "The abstract for the paper titled \"Victory\u2019s Shadow: Conquest and Governance in Medieval Catalonia\" by Thomas W. Barton is as follows:\n\n\"The field of medieval Iberian studies, once dominated in the United States by the Reconquista and Convivencia paradigms, has opened to new avenues of inquiry in recent years (e.g., Christian royal women\u2019s power and authority), while on the other side of the Atlantic, feudalism and the restructuring of agrarian societies and landscapes remain strong methodological frameworks. Straddling these trends but decidedly charting its own course is the book under review. *Victory\u2019s Shadow* is a political history of medieval Catalonia. Situated on the northeastern corner of the Iberian Peninsula, Catalonia formed a constellation of rival counties until its most powerful county, that of Barcelona, united with the royal house of Aragon in the early twelfth century to form the composite monarchy known as the Crown of Aragon\u2014a key player in Spain\u2019s medieval history.\n\n*Victory\u2019s Shadow* focuses on the establishment of comital, and later comital-royal, authority over New Catalonia (Lleida and Tortosa), by examining what the author calls the cycles of conquest, delegation to lords, seigniorial aggrandizement, and domain recuperation from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries. (The Lower Aragon region, despite being part of the Crown of Aragon and experiencing similar cycles, does not receive much attention.) Barton argues that victory in conquest did not necessarily translate into successful governance but was hampered by the inability of counts and count-kings to consolidate and centralize their power over conquered territories. The rulers\u2019 need to delegate conquered lands to nobles illustrates this governmental failure\u2014the shadow to their victory. Rather than a progressive expansion of the core\u2019s institutions and customs into peripheral conquered territories, as Robert Bartlett envisioned for medieval Europe in *The Making of the Twelfth Century: Conquest, Colonization, and Cultural Change* (1993), Barton\u2019s study of high medieval Catalonia reveals great heterogeneity in forms of land tenure, jurisdiction, customary traditions, peasant conditions, and treatment of Jewish and Muslim minorities.\n\nThe book is divided into three chronological parts. Completing the volume are several helpful maps (although, the captions for maps 3 and 4 are mismatched) and rulers\u2019 genealogical trees. Part 1, \u201cInteraction and Conquest,\u201d examines the shifting relationship between Christian and Muslim rulers in the northeastern borderlands following the caliphate\u2019s disintegration (chap. 1), the competition between the kings of Aragon and the counts of Barcelona and Urgell over the Andalusi Upper Frontier (chap. 2), and the momentous Barcelona-Aragon union and its impact on the count and now prince Ramon Berenguer IV\u2019s expansionist campaign, which ultimately led to the capture of Tortosa in 1148 and Lleida\u2019s surrender a year later. The adroit political maneuvering of the counts of Urgell, sandwiched between expansionist Aragon and Barcelona, is amply expounded throughout the book, as is the continued papal involvement in shaping the frontier, alongside Trans-Pyrenean, Pisan, and Genoese actors.\n\nPart 2, \u201cThe Implications of Victory,\u201d focuses on the consolidation process during the reigns of Ramon Berenguer IV and his successors, count-kings Alfons I and Pere I. Whereas, as Barton argues, Ramon Berenguer IV had a balanced conquest-consolidation policy over New Catalonia despite the jurisdictional wrangling that ensued over preconquest pledges to allies (chap. 4), Alfons struggled with expansion and a barely self-sufficient Lower Ebro region, while his son Pere, caught between trans-Pyrenean, Peninsular, and Mediterranean interests, buried himself in debt, pawning off comital-royal rights in Tortosa along the way (chap. 5). The approach to Lleida, however, was different, as count-kings were invested in making this territory a part of their patrimony (chap. 6).\n\nLastly, Part 3, \u201cNew Catalonia after Valencia,\u201d examines territorial expansion over Mallorca and Valencia and the strengthening of comital-royal authority during Jaume I\u2019s reign (1213\u201376), which was more often than not met with resistance by the barons, whose actions Barton describes as \u201cinsidious\u201d and \u201cobstreperous\u201d (224\u201325), unwittingly adopting the ruler\u2019s perspective (chap. 7). Chapter 8 delves into the fascinating contentious border between Aragon and Catalonia, with parties vigorously debating whether the Cinca River (approximately eighteen miles west of Lleida) or the Segre River (which crosses Lleida) constituted the boundary line. Contrary to the nationalist historiographic dictum that Lleida is as Catalonian as can be, Barton reveals a degree of shared culture between Aragon and Catalonia in the curious complaint of some Lleida residents against Jaume I\u2019s assignment of Lleida to Catalonia in 1244 (260).\n\nEspecially commendable in this book is Barton\u2019s painstaking scrutiny of hundreds of agreements between the counts and count-kings and other lords known as *convenientiae*. A case in point is the detailed study of the deal making that followed the 1209 death of Count Ermengol VIII; the count died without a male heir, and the book highlights the subsequent efforts of his daughter, Aurembiaix, one of the very few women that populates this book, to make good on her father\u2019s will. In this case and others, the author reads carefully between the lines to discern the parties\u2019 motivations, and precisely how in every instance each relationship played a role in the rulers\u2019 designs for the Crown.\n\nOn the question of designs, Barton treads unstable terrain. A question that frames this book is, \u201cDid \u2026 territorial accumulation facilitate further centralization throughout the conquering regime \u2026 ?\u201d (7). The short answer would be no, for, as Barton argues, the monarchy failed \u201cto implement its emerging sovereign ideology and to apply sophisticated, efficacious techniques of consolidation\u201d (5). Despite its enduring historiographical tradition, this approach seems problematic, as it sets rulers up for failure. In expecting the governance of Ramon Berenguer IV and his immediate successors to measure up against Jaume I\u2019s centralizing reign, we find twelfth-century rulers sorely lacking. A more fruitful approach would be to envision the political landscape of this period as a \u201ccluster of [competing] lordships\u201d (7), which might help reevaluate the county of Barcelona\u2019s evolving history as one among many contending for power, not as a prefiguration of the Crown of Aragon in the late thirteenth century. These remarks notwithstanding, *Victory\u2019s Shadow* is an important contribution to the field, of interest also to those studying multicultural frontiers in the medieval period and beyond.\"",
    "10.1242/jeb.236877": "When you picture a fish that spends its whole life constantly swimming at high speed, you probably see a tuna or marlin \u2013 something that cruises miles and miles each day through the open ocean. These fish generally have crescent-shaped tails with a narrow caudal peduncle \u2013 the part of the fish tail just before the tail fin \u2013 built for efficient swimming 24/7. However, fish living in fast-flowing rivers also need to swim fast constantly to be successful. The main difference from their deep-sea counterparts is that these riverine fish are swimming as hard as they can to go nowhere; they are essentially on a giant water treadmill. Living in torrential rapids, these fish need specialized traits to help them swim all day just to stay in the same spot, a behavior known as station-holding, to avoid getting washed downstream. Are the adaptations for swimming constantly in a flowing river to station-hold like those for roaming the relatively calm open ocean at speed?\n\nTo find out, a group of scientists from Northern Arizona University, USA, led by Daniel Kimball in Alice Gibb's lab, looked at the tail anatomy of three species of minnow from the southwestern USA to compare with that of tuna and other open ocean cruisers. These closely related minnows \u2013 bonytail, humpback chub and roundtail chub, listed in descending order of flow preference \u2013 are some of the species that traverse the world-famous rapids of the Colorado River as it passes through the Grand Canyon. Building on previous work, Kimball and colleagues found that not only does the bonytail have spines for muscle attachment on its vertebral column, which insert at sharper angles than for your typical fish, but the angle of these spines gets shallower from head to tail. This makes its caudal peduncle much thinner and more streamlined than those of most other fish, independently evolving the same shape as the tuna tail, despite being completely unrelated. Meanwhile, the slower-water preferring roundtail chub had more obtuse vertebral spines with a thicker, more typical tail shape.\n\nTails are more than just bones, though. How does the bonytail's tail muscles and connective tissues compare with those of tuna and other oceanic speedy species that prefer slower moving water? Kimball and colleagues tried stretching the muscles that move the minnows\u2019 tails to find out how much force they can withstand. They also measured how much collagen, a tough connective tissue, was found in these muscles by examining them under a microscope. The team found that the tail muscles of the bonytail resisted tearing better than those of the other species, with roundtail chub having the least tear-resistant muscles. This means that compared with its lazier, though still relatively active relatives, the bonytail can safely transmit a lot more force through its tail to propel itself through fast-flowing rapids. Additionally, the team found that the muscles powering the bonytail's tail had more collagen than its other muscles, which was not seen in the other species. This suggests their tail muscles may act like the springy tendons of tuna tails, storing elastic energy on each tail movement, allowing bonytails to swim efficiently at high speeds.\n\nWhile there may not be any freshwater tuna, bonytails come as close as possible thanks to convergent evolution allowing both species to arrive at the same solution for high performance swimming. However, instead of swimming non-stop to cross entire oceans, bonytails swim non-stop just to stay still in fast-flowing rivers. Like a cross-country runner on a treadmill, the bonytail could cruise through the oceans with tunas if they wanted to, but prefer the scenic landscape of the Grand Canyon.",
    "10.3928/00989134-20210309-04": "Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are web-based, fully operational courses designed at scale for open global enrollment. Courses cover a wide array of diverse topics and can vary in terms of effort level and pedagogical approach. They have evolved from an experiment in global course interactions to offering college credit, professional certifications, professional development credits, college course supplemental material, incorporation in college campus education, and career gap\u2013specific courses while reaching as many learners as possible. Most are associated with universities and taught by professors, produced via a partnership of universities with online learning platforms, such as edX\u00ae and Coursera. A variety of educational tools can be incorporated, such as interactive modules, video lectures, reference materials, assessments, collaborative lessons, discussion boards, and peer-reviewed assignments. Newer MOOCs feature chatbots and adaptive algorithm models that adjust to learners' prior knowledge and question responsiveness. They can be easily accessed by anyone, provided they have an internet connection, language proficiency (most are only available in English), and computer literacy (Setia et al., 2019). Many MOOCs offer an audit track, which provides access to all course materials for a limited time except graded assignments; they are typically free but learners are unable to earn a \u201ccertificate\u201d under this option. To earn a verified certificate, learners pay a fee and must complete specified assessments, discussions, and/or other assigned learning activities.\n\nMillions of learners of various ages, backgrounds, interests, and goals typically enroll in these courses. As a form of e-learning, MOOCs continue to emerge as a particularly valuable strategy to address some of the training challenges experienced in developing countries by supporting efficient content delivery, decreasing costs, and increasing access (Liyanagunawardena & Aboshady, 2018). MOOCs have been shown to significantly improve outreach regarding public health concerns, as well as providing necessary training for health care professionals and the general public. The most recent report presented at the edX Virtual Forum (2020) documents >35 million learners with 110 million unique enrollments spanning 196 countries. Furthermore, MOOCs are particularly suited for addressing health topics while attracting global learners from low-resource contexts (Barteit et al., 2019). Currently, health and medicine are estimated to account for only a small percentage of MOOCs; topics have included nutrition, stress management, alternative therapies, mental health, ethics, global health, and health care leadership. Other courses are more disease- or condition-specific, such as hypertension, menopause, and pediatric injuries, as well as HIV and addiction. However, what seems to be substantially lacking are courses focused on conditions related to aging and issues impacting older adults.\n\nAs part of a concerted effort to address this dearth of gero-focused content, two MOOCs were launched by Salisbury University's School of Nursing in conjunction with USMx, an initiative through the University System of Maryland's William E. Kirwan Center for Academic Innovation (access https://www.edx.org/course/overview-management-ofparkinsons-disease-2; https://www.edx.org/course/alzheimers-disease-dementia-care). The two courses, titled Overview of Parkinson's Disease & Management and Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Care, were purposely designed to appeal to lay persons and caregivers, as well as health care professionals working with these patient populations. These courses include a variety of teaching modalities to enhance learner engagement, such as introductory/summary videos for each of the five modules, check your knowledge questions, web links, embedded visuals/videos, as well as video interviews with a person with Parkinson's disease and an Alzheimer's care-giver, respectively, followed by reflective discussion. The response to these self-paced, gero-focused offerings has been overwhelmingly positive, and data show the goal of reaching a wide audience with varying skills was exceeded within the first year. Collectively, there are >12,000 learners and growing, reaching more than 140 countries, with the United States only making up 15% to 20% of the enrolled population. Of these learners who self-reported demographic information for the two courses, approximately 65% are female and 35% are male and median age is 28 years. Approximately 26% have a high school diploma or less, and 24% have an advanced degree. Although these MOOCs, which launched in late 2019/early 2020, likely experienced heightened interest due to the COVID-19\u2013induced lockdown worldwide, the far-reaching nature of these courses as a cost-effective way to introduce a widespread audience to pertinent gerontological topics of interest is markedly clear.\n\nEven with their growing popularity, scholarly debate continues regarding benefits versus concerns when offering free and open content to an international audience. Limitations can include low-quality or non-engaging instruction, passive learning, course difficulty, and low average completion rates despite free content (Setia et al., 2019). High drop-out rates remain a much-criticized issue (Chan et al., 2019). Suggested strategies for improving participation and completion rates while enhancing perceived value would include offering courses of shorter duration and incorporating good-quality media. Furthermore, advertising courses through multiple credible channels (including social media platforms) can spread awareness about e-learning opportunities (Setia et al., 2019). Incentives can include offering certificates, credits, or professional credit; providing learning support and learner feedback; and using data to analyze drop-out points to drive course improvements (Chan et al., 2019).\n\nMOOCs can provide a free and accessible way for learners to be exposed to new topics or disciplines while providing a forum to stimulate new interests and ideas. They can serve as an effective and efficient method to provide education regarding health topics while creating a diverse and interactive community of global learners. MOOCs that address issues specific to the geriatric population can go beyond disease-oriented topics to those that explore broader concerns related to aging, such as polypharmacy, health promotion, transitions in care, end-of-life decision making, and the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in optimizing care outcomes. Although MOOCs can be resource-intensive to develop, the rewards of educating a global audience can be particularly satisfying. High-quality MOOCs developed by knowledgeable faculty and/or expert health care professionals can provide a learning environment where gerontological nurses and other health care providers, as well as lay persons/caregivers from various geographic regions, cultures, and backgrounds, can connect and share experiences. Nursing faculty, in collaboration with practicing gerontological nurses, have the opportunity to provide cutting edge MOOCs to not only enhance learning among students and health care peers to enhance practice, but also inform the global community at large about pertinent geriatric topics.",

Wearable technology can be used to help detect, quantify, and mitigate these PD tremors. Among the wearable technology, PD tremor detection is the primary step for further analysis and treatment using wearable devices. Some researchers have explored PD rest tremor detection. However, less research has been done concerning postural tremor and action tremor detection, which are difficult to classify only using frequency-domain features. In this paper, we propose TremorSense, a PD tremor detection system to classify Parkinson's Disease hand tremors. TremorSense utilizes accelerometers and gyroscopes as wearable sensors on patients' wrists to collect data from 30 PD patients. We develop the TremorSense Android application that connects the sensors via Bluetooth to save the data. Furthermore, we design an 8-Layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify PD rest, postural, and action tremors. We evaluate the CNN model with self-evaluation, cross-evaluation, and leave-one-out evaluation, and the accuracies for all three evaluations are greater than 94%.",

The purpose of this study was to assess attitudes towards honey bees of adults visiting a honey bee information table at a University's weeklong pollinator event in the spring of 2019. Attitudes were assessed utilizing 12 statements scored on a 5-point Likert scale of strongly agree to strongly disagree. Relationships between demographics and attitudes were explored using chi-square test and Bonferroni correction. Attitudes towards honey bees were, overall, positive. Participants recognize the intelligence of honey bees and agree it is important to learn about honey bees, protect them, and that they are an important part of the environment. They disagreed that they felt fear when near a honey bee, and disagreed that it is better to kill a bee than be stung. Additionally, they disagreed that they would kill a honey bee found in their home. Participants strongly disagreed that honey bees are dangerous. Significant relationships were found between the number of times a person was stung and attitudes towards learning about honey bees and whether a person felt that killing a honey bee is better than being stung. A significant relationship was also found between geographic location and the importance of honey bees to the environment. This study highlighted the need to continue education and exposure of the public to honey bees in order to positively affect perceptions.",

The 4-week bodyweight circuit exercise protocol (i.e., jumping jacks; modified push-ups; high knees; squat; mountain climbers; and lunges) was performed 3d/wk for four weeks. Maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) were performed using a handgrip dynamometer. During each contraction, surface electromyography (sEMG) and force signals were recorded to assess sEMG amplitude (RMS) of flexor carpi radialis muscle as well as peak force (PF). Additionally, the brachial artery's resting blood pressure (BP) in a fasted state was recorded before and after the 4-week intervention. BP was self-monitored by participants once a day for 4 weeks to evaluate systolic and diastolic pressure readings. Two-way ANOVAs with factors of group [i.e., home-based exercise (HBE); control (CON)] and time [i.e., pre-post] were used to analyze pre- and post-testing measures.\n\n**RESULTS:** No significant (p > 0.05) differences between groups were observed in resting BP and sEMG-RMS.

This project aims to study and develop image processing and machine learning algorithms to segment and track the size of the tumor regions affected by the anti-cancer bacteria based on the diffusion-weighted MRI images (DWI) collected from animal tumor models over the course of treatment, providing methods of evaluating its effectiveness. We employ emerging image processing and machine learning techniques that are implemented in MATLAB and Python to create algorithms consisting of pre-processing, processing, and post-processing steps, with the goal of calculating the destructed tumor tissue volume at each stage of the treatment. To automate the pre-processing and identification steps of the tumor region, a convolutional neural network called a U-Net is utilized to predict a binary mask to identify and crop the raw MRI images around the tumor prior to the processing and the post-processing steps, then the algorithm calculates the total volume of the tumor, dead tissue, and live tissue. The U-Net is trained using binary masks of the tumor regions alongside the original MRI images. The developed algorithms allow researchers to quantitatively determine the effectiveness of the BBCT by tracking the volume of dead tumor tissues. Ultimately, this research could lead to an automated 3D volumetric tumor tissue destruction measured in vivo longitudinally in the DWI experiments.",

It\u2019s not just that they rarely speak about the war; they typically have less dialogue overall than other characters, even as they appear in many scenes of the film and are often at the center of it. For Bartle, the protagonist of *The Yellow Birds* (Alexandre Moors, 2017), based on a novel of the same name by Kevin Powers (2012), silence is a survival tool during training; early on, for instance, he urges Murph, who will eventually become his best friend, to be quiet lest their sergeant hear them talking while they\u2019re loading clips on the firing range. Silence for the post-war Bartle, however, is different, bound up not just with the combat he takes part in, but also with guilt, both for Murph\u2019s death and for a war crime that the film gradually reveals. And while not every contemporary film about returning veterans has a war crime at its center\u2014many such films, in fact, emphasize the veteran\u2019s heroism\u2014almost all cinematic combat veterans begin the film in silence.\n\nThis silence is but the first step in a remarkably consistent generic arc: the cinematic veteran, returned to the United States, is characterized by silence; the narrative works toward a moment, either positioned as the climax or very nearly there, where the veteran tells their story; the story is told to a listener who often directly elicits the story; and once this story is told, the narrative implies a healing of wounds, with a promise of the veteran rejoining the community, often through the listener. (The consequences of not telling the story result in a different outcome, as we will see.) This arc is also one that we find in cinematic veterans on screen in earlier eras; Keith Beattie, whose work I discuss at greater length below, has traced out the Vietnam Veteran\u2019s movement from silence to speech in narrative representation. But whereas for Beattie\u2019s Vietnam Veteran, that transformation took years, the contemporary arc takes a mere two hours, and it occurs every time we view the films. And even if this was true for some earlier films as well, the consistency of the contemporary arc within a feature-film time-frame bears scrutiny here.\n\nThis essay will trace out this arc, and explore each stage of it, within a single film: *The Yellow Birds*. By examining *The Yellow Birds*, my hope is that it might bring us a bit closer to understanding the stories we are telling ourselves about military veterans returning from contemporary U.S. wars. In doing so, I hope to begin shedding light on the ways we view those veterans, the ways we view those wars, and the truth and lies we tell ourselves about both.",

Investigations into specific behaviors and practices that influence arterial stiffness has been a priority in the past few years. Chronic aerobic and anaerobic exercise activity has consistently shown to attenuate or not influence markers of arterial stiffness in adults with chronic disease and otherwise healthy adults. Chronic high functional resistance training\u2019s effect on vascular compliance is less understood.\n\n**PURPOSE:** To determine the effects of a chronic high functional resistance training program on pulse wave velocity and beta-stiffness index.\n\n**METHODS:** Participants (18-40 years old) were placed in a non-randomized fashion into high functional resistance training (HFRT) group (n = 9; >6 months of CrossFit experience; 4 female), or control (CON) group (n = 8; < 6 months of exercise experience; 6 female). Participants in the HFRT group trained at the same local facility 4 -5 days a week, utilizing the same training program. CON group refrained from exercise during the study period. Body composition, 1,000 meter rowing test, deadlift 1 repetition maximum (1 RM), hemodynamic assessments and vascular compliance was assessed at baseline and follow-up.

The impact of this type of training on arterial stiffness is less understood. \n**PURPOSE**: To investigate the acute effects of autoregulated (AR) and non-autoregulated (NAR) BFR exercise on indices of arterial stiffness. AR BFR training devices adjust pressure in the cuff ensuring similar pressure throughout the range of motion when the muscles are contracted (dilatated) and relaxed. NAR BFR training devices do not adjust pressure in the cuff throughout the range of motion when the muscles are contracted and relaxed which cause greater pressures at different points in the range of motion. \n**METHODS**: Following a randomized AR or NAR familiarization training session, 20 adults (23 \u00b1 5 years; 7 female) participated in 3 randomized treatment-order sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no-BFR separated by 1-week washout periods. Participants performed 4 sets of dumbbell wall squats to failure using 20% of 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) at 2-second concentric/eccentric cadence. Pneumatic straps were placed around the proximal portion of each thigh and training limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both the AT and NAR sessions. Testing before and immediately following the training session included ultrasonography of the carotid artery, applanation tonometry, and blood pressure acquisition.

However, NA-BFR significantly increased CSA and EI compared to A-BFR. Since EI is inversely related to muscle quality, these findings suggest that autoregulated pressure in A-BFR can cause a lower fluid flux to the intracellular space and possibly less muscle damage and swelling than NA-BFR.",

We also investigated niche overlap in habitat and food resources between C. guttata and other, more common, turtle species. Our data indicated that the abundance of C. guttata was negatively correlated with dissolved O2 and pH levels and positively correlated with body of water depth and canopy cover. The investigation of niche overlap revealed that Mud Turtles (Kinosternon subrubrum) and Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta), but not Snapping Turtles (Chelydra serpentina), were negatively correlated with the abundance of C. guttata despite differences in characteristics of bodies of water used by each species.

Most amphibians have a biphasic lifestyle and are susceptible to threats in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Eastern Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum) are endangered throughout much of their range in the eastern United States, including Maryland and Delaware. Ambystoma t. tigrinum breed in ephemeral freshwater ponds and then migrate into the surrounding terrestrial environment after metamorphosis. Limited research exists about what habitat characteristics play a role in breeding pond use. We sought to understand what features of the breeding pond and surrounding landscape influence abundance and occupancy. We measured salamander occupancy, salamander abundance, and water quality parameters at ponds during the 2018 and 2019 breeding seasons. We used geographic information systems to determine pond area and the percentage of forest area and road density surrounding a pond at four spatial scales. Pond occupancy by A. t. tigrinum was positively associated with increased depth and less forest cover at the largest spatial scales. Abundance of A. t. tigrinum was greatest in larger, deeper ponds, potentially because these factors increase hydroperiod. More basic pH and decreased conductivity were also associated with higher male salamander abundances in ponds. Forest area and road density were not in the top-ranked model, although we note that ponds in this study had a minimum of 70% forest area within 150 m. Our findings elucidate relationships between A. t. tigrinum and their habitat, providing knowledge for future management of this state-endangered species.",

Although the study is limited to this case, the author demonstrates how these organizations differ despite serving overlapping constituencies and facing similar political hazards. He seeks to explain why some organizations effectively empower poor, marginalized, and exploited populations while others weaken the struggle for justice, freedom, and abolitionist demands.\n\nForrest argues that social justice organizations encounter resistance from social, economic, and institutional forces seeking to displace, subvert, and destroy movements to abolish oppression. These factors include neoliberal ideology encouraging the marketization of public goods like education. Combined with demands placed on workers and individuals operating under capitalism, social justice organizations experience unequal participation and access to resources based on socioeconomic status. Like Martin Gilens argued in Affluence and Influence, the demands placed on workers and individuals under capitalism constrain the influence of social justice organizations, creating inequalities in participation and resources based on socioeconomic status. Forrest convincingly argues that before the 2008 Great Recession, the Obama administration and local governments administered policies reflecting neoliberal values. Prioritizing bailouts for financial institutions, corporations, and wealthy investors, instead of policies to bail out low-income, Black, and disadvantaged communities, marginalized communities became targets for financial institutions with high-interest subprime and otherwise predatory mortgage products.\n\nAs discussed in Race for Profit: How Banks and the Real Estate Industry Undermined Black Homeownership by Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, racial oppression that contributed to housing segregation, Black poverty, and reinforced institutional racism was replaced by government-insured mortgage-lending exploitation. Forrest provides a clearly articulated theory and compelling explanation of housing insecurity, education, poverty, and the fight for social justice. He contributes to this literature by discussing how predatory lending practices fueled the housing crisis. Lasting and disproportionately high foreclosure rates among Black women are related to these pernicious practices. The disparities are politicized by framing the Black community as \u201cirresponsible borrowers.\u201d He effectively shows how this context (i.e., underfunded education systems, foreclosures, housing insecurity, and poverty) affected the goals and mobilization of social movement organizations. \n\nForrest contends that respectability politics and conventional rhetoric lead social justice organizations to diminish, obscure, and deny abolitionist demands. Like arguments presented during the Civil Rights era, many activists believe that the demands of social movements should be pragmatic and achieved through conventional political means. Contentious identities are fashioned to reject the stigmatization of targeted groups like Black women, low-income people, and working-class constituencies. Instead of operating on the basis of the assumption that Black people are irresponsible borrowers, effective social movements use adversarial contentious identities that challenge social ignorance. For instance, the author discusses how the Welfare Rights Committee combatted social ignorance by deploying etiquette, contentious identity, and rhetoric that \u201cproblematized societal ignorance about the market-based system of oppression.\u201d\n\nThe need for authenticity and oppositional narratives that foreground abolitionist demands and raise awareness of injustice effectively challenged systems of oppression. In this book, Forrest has examined social justice organizations in a manner that clarifies the complexity of grassroots organizing. As scholars and activists continue to interrogate social problems linked to racism, housing insecurity, and the COVID crisis, this volume advances knowledge about social justice movements and inequality in America. Readers interested in understanding how organizations have effectively advocated for abolitionist demands will benefit from reading this book.",
    "10.1093/ahr/rhad071": "In his *Ecclesiastical History*, Eusebius recounted how in 250 Christians in Alexandria courageously cared for the victims of an epidemic. Without thinking of their safety, they embraced their loved ones as death approached. Their pagan neighbors, on the other hand, abandoned their family members in fear and left them to die alone in the streets. These Alexandrian Christians were practicing *philanthropia*, the virtue the apostle Paul called *agape* (love, charity), but they did not extend this philanthropy to pagans. In the next hundred years, however, Christians began to assist all men and women regardless of their religious beliefs.\n\nScholars studying Christian philanthropy in the Early Byzantine period (323 to 642) attribute this expanding scope of Christian charity to Constantine\u2019s conversion and the subsequent Christianization of the Roman state. In *The Rich and the Pure: Philanthropy and the Making of Christian Society in Early Byzantium*, Daniel Caner has undertaken a far more thorough analysis of this shift in Christian philanthropy. By examining various terms that Christian writers chose to emphasize different aspects of Paul\u2019s *agape*, Caner traces out more precisely how these shifts occurred.\n\nCaner agrees that the conversion of Constantine changed philanthropy from a virtue of Christian life into a pillar of the East Roman state. In 572, the emperor Tiberius II maintained that justice and philanthropy were the two pillars that supported the empire\u2019s tranquility. Caner, however, also investigates how these changes in the state shaped thinking about philanthropy among Christian intellectuals. In pursuing this goal, he has uncovered an array of sources that scholars in this field have previously ignored. For example, he analyzes a passage in an anonymous text from fourth-century Syria, *The Clementine Homilies*, a fictitious story about Peter and his disciple Clement. In one scene, Peter explains to Clement that *philanthropia* must be offered to all, the good and the bad, as the heavenly Father sent life-giving rain to both virtuous and evil men (Matt. 5:45). Giving to someone because of pity or an obligation to repay a past favor is commendable, but not true philanthropy.\n\nCaner also discusses the institutional expressions of philanthropy that suddenly appeared in cities in the early Byzantine Empire\u2014hospitals, hospices, and *ptochotropheia* (literally poor houses). The famous theologian and bishop Basil of Caesarea opened such a philanthropic institution, his *ptochotropheion*, outside Caesarea, ca. 370. Caner, however, convincingly argues that this institution was not a house for homeless people as its name implies, nor a hospital as many scholars claim, but a facility to care solely for lepers. Indeed, sources that describe it mention only leprous residents. Moreover, Gregory of Nazianzos, a close friend of Basil, delivered a sermon on caring for *ptochoi* (the poor) in which the term *ptochos* is synonymous with \u201cleper.\u201d\n\nCaner demonstrates that Basil considered his *ptochotropheion* a school where the *ptochoi* in body (lepers) learned to be *ptochoi* in spirit\u2014that is, monks. According to Caner, the message of both Basil and Gregory of Nazianzos was that leprosy purified its victims and, when rightly considered, made them monks. This argument, along with those presented below, convinced most Christians that monks and their monasteries were worthy recipients of *philanthropia*, along with lepers, the sick, and the aged.\n\nCaner analyzes five terms\u2014alms (*ele\u0113mosyn\u0113*), charity (*agape*), blessing (*eulogia*), first fruits (*karpophorai*), and liturgical offerings (*prosphorai*)\u2014which apply to philanthropy but emphasize different dimensions of the virtue. For example, one gives alms out of pity for victims of misfortune or to gain one\u2019s salvation, but charity is total self-giving. The Egyptian monk Agathon described charity as exchanging one\u2019s own healthy body for that of a leper; here the *ptochos* in spirit yearns to be *ptochos* in body.\n\nBlessing, on the other hand, applies to God\u2019s philanthropy to humans, as in the case of Saint Euthemius\u2019s monastery south of Jerusalem. When four hundred Armenian pilgrims arrived at the gates, the monastery\u2019s pantry, which earlier had been almost empty, was so full of bread that the cellarer could scarcely close its door. Men and women imitated God\u2019s *eulogia* by blessing monasteries and philanthropic institutions with donations ranging from simple gifts of food to huge estates.\n\nFirst fruits (*prosphorai*), on the other hand, were thank offerings that men and women offered to God in return for his many blessings. During the early Byzantine period, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt usually experienced bountiful harvests; the population increased, and cultivated areas expanded. Many Christians believed that the prayers of the pure, the celibate monks, had obtained these increasing yields from the hand of God. Monastic writers maintained that monks\u2019 prayers helped to restore the balance of nature and to reunite matter and spirit, separated at the Fall. Thus, it was appropriate to offer monks the first fruits of the fields. In fact, this was a key philanthropic act since it sustained society\u2019s abundant supply of food.\n\nFinally, Caner examined liturgical offerings (*prosphorai*), a form of philanthropy that had developed from offerings of bread and wine for the Eucharistic sacrifice. By the fifth century, however, this custom had expanded to include every sort of donation from food to large estates. Again, Caner introduced a rarely cited source, a sermon by Jacob of Serug, a bishop from northern Mesopotamia. He wrote this sermon in verse to explain how gifts offered as part of the Eucharistic offering won forgiveness for the sins of those who had died.\n\nCaner\u2019s book is complex and requires careful reading, but it is a gold mine of previously overlooked sources, such as this poetic sermon by Jacob of Serug. Any student of Christian philanthropy, and given its intimate connection with asceticism, of Christian monasticism as well, will benefit from *The Rich and the Pure*.",

AR BFR cuffs adjust pressure as the muscle undergoes concentric and eccentric contractions, maintaining a constant pressure in the limb throughout the entire range of motion. NAR BFR training cuffs do not adjust pressure throughout the range of motion thus causing greater pressures in the limb during concentric contraction when the muscle size is enlarged. How this exercise acutely impacts arterial stiffness in upper body exercise is not well understood.\n\n**METHODS**: Following a randomized familiarization period with AR or NAR BFR biceps curl exercise, 33 adults (20 \u00b1 2 years; 11 females) participated in 3 randomized sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no-BFR (no cuffs) separated by 1-week washout periods. Using 20% of the 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) with 2-second concentric/eccentric cadence, participants performed 4 sets of biceps curls to failure. Training limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both BFR sessions. Measurements before and immediately following the training session included blood pressure acquisition, arterial tonometry, and ultrasonography of the carotid artery. Between and within effects of treatment on central systolic blood pressure (cSBP), central diastolic BP (cDBP), central pulse pressure (cPP), central mean arterial pressure (cMAP), pulse wave velocity (PWV), beta-stiffness index (\u03b2-stiff), and arterial compliance (AC) were analyzed with two-way ANOVAs.\n\n**RESULTS**: There were no baseline differences in variable of interest (all p > 0.05). cDBP increased posted exercise in all three groups (AR-BFR mean difference (MD) = 7 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01; NAR-BFR MD = 6 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01; no BFR MD = 5 \u00b1 1 mmHg, p < 0.01). And there was a non-significant trend in \u03b2-stiff (MD = 1.25 \u00b1 0.46 au, p = 0.07) and AC (MD = -0.3 \u00b1 0.1 mm\u00b2/mmHg x 10\u207b\u00b9, p = 0.07) with the no BFR treatment.\n\n**CONCLUSION**: The present findings show acute AR-BFR and NAR-BFR bicep training did not impact arterial stiffness.",

AR-BFR pressure cuffs adjust pressure automatically, maintaining a similar pressure during concentric and eccentric phases. However, NAR-BFR pressure cuffs do not accommodate for larger muscle diameters during the concentric phase, creating higher limb pressures compared to the eccentric phase.\n\n**METHODS:** Accordingly, 33 adults (21 \u00b1 2 years; 11 females) participated in the upper body and 20 adults (23 \u00b1 5 years; 7 females) participated in the lower body in treatment-order exercise sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no BFR in a randomized fashion separated by 1-week and included a familiarization session. All participants in the upper body sessions performed four sets of dumbbell curls and all participants in the lower body sessions performed four sets of wall squats with handheld dumbbells to volitional fatigue using 20% of their 1-RM with 2-second cadence and 1 minute rest periods. Cuffs were placed at the proximal portion of the arms and thighs, and limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both BFR treatments during the exercise and rest periods for both the upper and lower body sessions, respectively. Subjective measurements of RPE, RPD, and the 1-10 Likert scale were taken immediately post-exercise while the cuffs were inflated. Two-way ANOVAs were conducted on variables of interest.\n\n**RESULTS:** There were no significant differences in RPE between AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no BFR in the upper and lower body sessions (p = 0.13). There was a significant difference in RDP between upper body AR-BFR and no BFR (mean difference (MD) = 2.23 \u00b1 0.47, p < 0.01) and upper body NAR-BFR and no BFR (mean difference (MD) = 1.32 \u00b1 0.47, p = 0.05).\n\n**CONCLUSION:** The use of BFR does not appear to influence subjective ratings of exertion in the upper and lower limbs. Additionally, AR-BFR and NAR-BFR devices may cause more subjective discomfort compared to no BFR.",

    "10.1093/ahr/rhae266": "**Abstract:**\n\n*Writing Labor\u2019s Emancipation*, Greg Hall\u2019s excellent biography of Jay Fox, traces the life of a forgotten activist who, after experiencing the Haymarket tragedy firsthand, dedicated his life to the cause of labor and the duty to educate through the printed word. Born in New Jersey to Irish parents\u2014he is mislabeled as \u201cIrish-born\u201d in some previous studies\u2014Fox followed the trajectory of most foreign-born workers who became anarchists. Contrary to stereotypes, the majority of immigrant anarchists radicalized after their arrival when confronted with the brutalities of American capitalism. It is one of Hall\u2019s arguments that Fox, too, became radicalized after experiencing the assault of a grinding and profoundly unfair economy that left millions of working families voiceless and trapped. Other than a labor activist, Fox was a journalist, printer, and a participant in the anarchist commune at Home, Washington. He witnessed the horror at Haymarket and the subsequent backlash against labor. Like many anarchists, he was involved in several free-speech fights and was indicted himself, leading to a conviction under the anti-anarchist laws enacted after President McKinley\u2019s assassination. His strong support for a more inclusive industrial unionism landed him at the 1905 founding convention of the Industrial Workers of the World.\n\n*Writing Labor\u2019s Emancipation* reveals a profoundly human story of a devoted radical who held differing philosophical and pragmatic ideas simultaneously. One of the strengths of Hall\u2019s study is showing how challenging it could be to marry anarchist principles to a commitment to organized labor in a greedy, industrializing society. Fox was a philosophical anarchist, but he debated and adopted various approaches as a trade unionist. First, he veered toward syndicalism, the idea that unions would replace corporate and state structures in a new society. In this sense, Fox was similar to the Chicago anarchist labor activists Albert Parsons and August Spies, who both need updated biographies in English. Fox was mainly active in trade unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, which challenges the historiography of the AFL in a small way. He helped found the IWW but criticized its dual unionism. In the wake of the Great War, Fox experienced another change of heart when he advocated that workers attain political power and join a labor party. From there, he became a communist and even supported the Bolsheviks, perhaps his most controversial decision. However, he continued to work on a history of anarchism, which he refused to repudiate. Hall\u2019s probing and sensitive portrait of Fox\u2019s political evolution contributes to an ongoing scholarly discussion centered around the interaction between anarchists and the post\u2013Civil War labor movement. There is an assumption within labor history that American anarchism from 1880 to 1920 was an extremist fringe phenomenon unmoored from the labor movement. This is an incomplete picture at best. Jay Fox\u2019s political and intellectual life testifies to the strong bond between anarchists, anarchist ideas, and the movement for labor emancipation, even after 1920. \u201cInfusing the labor movement with anarchism,\u201d argues Hall, \u201cwas his distinctive contribution as a radical, a revolutionary, and a unionist\u201d (40). Hall\u2019s biography contextualizes anarchists like Fox within the union movement the way James Green\u2019s *Death in the Haymarket* (2007) placed the early Chicago anarchists in the broader context of trade unionism, syndicalism, the eight-hour-day movement, and anti-monopolist sentiment.\n\n*Writing Labor\u2019s Emancipation* also contributes to our understanding of anarchist print culture, a vital component of a decentralized movement without political parties or electoral campaigns. One cannot overstate this point. The thousands of anarchist papers, bulletins, zines, and pamphlets printed and distributed in dozens of languages in the United States function as the fabric and forum of the movement and attest to its resilience and precariousness. Any assessment of the anarchist movement that fails to consult its own print sources and instead only uses official records and mainstream newspapers is not only inadequate but suspect. Through the printed and spoken word, anarchists like Fox broadcast a counternarrative that could jolt complacent minds into questioning received authority. Hall\u2019s other central argument is that writing and editing was Fox\u2019s \u201cprimary activity as an anarchist\u201d and that he exerted more influence with his pen than with his union card (61). Most anarchists believed that a printing press could stimulate a shared education and the spirit of solidarity that empowers the oppressed profoundly. Fox sought readership, not leadership (3). In this respect, Hall\u2019s book joins recent studies that expand our knowledge of anarchist print culture. Christopher Casta\u00f1eda and Montse Feu edited *Writing Revolution: Hispanic Anarchism in the United States* (2019), a unique volume that maps and analyzes a transnational movement through its rich print culture. Kathy Ferguson wrote perhaps the definitive study of this topic, *Letterpress Revolution: The Politics of Anarchist Print Culture* (2023), a book that appeared after Hall\u2019s biography was published. Ferguson confirms that Fox was a tireless and effective anarchist printer and editor with technical and financial knowledge during rapid technological change. Fox and many other radicals believed an independent labor newspaper was \u201cas important as the union itself\u201d (182).\n\nThough Hall frequently mentions Fox\u2019s partners and daughter, readers may want more information about their individual lives and family dynamics, if sources exist. The discussion of Fox\u2019s occasional sexism and views on gender is crucial to providing a complete picture of a complicated personality and movement. More historians have started analyzing the anarchists\u2019 views on gender and race in the period of Jim Crow America, but more needs to be done. That said, Greg Hall has crafted a readable and impartial portrait of a deeply committed activist, enraged by the immiseration of labor, enthusiastic about labor\u2019s will to fight back, and committed to spreading ideas through independent media outlets.",
    "10.1093/ahr/rhae269": "Examples of hybridity in the areas of diplomacy, material culture, economic activities, and religion belied European colonists\u2019 stubborn efforts at claiming and enforcing ideological, physical, and spiritual separateness from Native peoples and cultures in Early America. Tattooing and scalping, two markedly Indigenous practices of body modification, elicited complicated and contradictory reactions from European and early American settler-colonists. Colonial authorities and individuals used elaborate scripting to come to terms with the uncomfortable reality that tattoos and scalps quickly became profoundly cross-cultural practices. Mairin Odle\u2019s sharply written *Under the Skin: Tattoos, Scalps, and the Contested Language of Bodies in Early America* fills an important gap in the existing literature, in which tattoos and scalps have typically been studied only tangentially to other topics, such as early intercultural encounters or imperial warfare. The author\u2019s critical choice of considering these two practices side by side, despite obvious differences in their purposes and sociopolitical contexts, allows her to develop a powerful argument about the embodied dimensions of settler-colonialism. *Under the Skin* convincingly shows that the contradictions and ambiguities surrounding colonial descriptions and practices of tattooing and scalping are revealing of the nature and contradictions of settler-colonialism itself. The volume is also notable for its piercing coverage of gendered dimensions of these two practices, despite their overwhelming association in colonial and modern imaginations with masculinity and war.\n\nA quick and stimulating read, the book is evenly split into two chapters focusing on tattoos and two chapters focusing on scalping, framed by an insightful introduction and epilogue.\n\nChapter 1 examines the first documented encounters between English colonial hopefuls and Indigenous tattooing, through the writings of Thomas Harriot and the accompanying watercolors of North Carolina Algonquians produced by John White in the late sixteenth century. Drawing on previous knowledge of pilgrimage tattoos and the markings of ancient Britons (Picts), colonial observers immediately conceptualized tattoos as \u201cwritten sign systems\u201d that could be deciphered and interpreted in order to identify specific Indigenous nations and meaningful hierarchies, with the ultimate goal of facilitating diplomacy and conquest. The terminology and cultural references used by Englishmen to make sense of Algonquian tattooing practices, including \u201cpinking, listing, cutting, engraving, and embroidering \u2026 had multiple and ambiguous associations with art, fashion, and writing\u201d (34). At once relatable and inescapably \u201csavage,\u201d tattoos contributed to the immediate \u201cothering\u201d of Native bodies. Still, as Odle convincingly argues, this phase of interactions was remarkable in that Englishmen showed much attention toward gendered aspects of tattooing and displayed a genuine curiosity toward deciphering bodily markings as a language \u201canalogous but not equivalent to their own writing\u201d (15).\n\nChapter 2 then transports the readers to the second half of the eighteenth century to explore the contradictory meanings of cross-cultural tattoos, especially in areas affected by the Seven Years\u2019 War. During this time, tattoos started intersecting more with scalping in that they became more strictly associated with \u201cmartial masculinity\u201d and the infliction of pain as either honorific or punishing. Both English and French colonists continued to attempt to read tattoos as infallible marks of status, military prowess, and identity. Yet, when applied to colonial bodies, the meanings of tattoos appeared increasingly ambiguous and contested, which the author attributes to \u201cconcerns about just how closely cultural identity and bodily integrity might\u2014or might not\u2014be intertwined\u201d (46). Drawing on previous scholarly interpretations and rich textual instances of cross-cultural tattoos, Odle suggests that the increasingly hybrid nature of tattooing was revelatory of a significant shift in power dynamics and the imposition of colonial meanings over Native lives.\n\nTurning her sights toward the nasty business of scalping in the second half of the book, Odle continues her meticulous investigation of the effects of colonial violence and its narrativization. In chapter 3, she establishes a remarkably nuanced timeline of the process by which scalps\u2014that of \u201cenemy Indians\u201d and sometimes Europeans\u2014went from being reluctantly accepted by late seventeenth-century New England authorities as a form of tribute to becoming the foundation of a complex set of legal regulations and administrative processes to manage a growing scalp-hunting and reward system. Just like the eradication of wolves from the region, Odle powerfully argues, \u201cstate-authorized scalp bounties can be understood as one instantiation of a settler-colonial \u2018logic of elimination\u2019\u2014stories that insist on the marginalization and attempted erasure of Native people in order that settlers might access territory\u201d (90). The famous case of Hannah Duston, who was celebrated as a Massachusetts hero for killing and bringing back the scalps of her Abenaki captors (men, women, and children) in 1697, captures the full contradictions of New Englanders\u2019 attitudes toward scalping, which could be condemned as barbaric when targeting whites, while being simultaneously encouraged, financially and socially rewarded, and heralded as legitimate modes of state violence when targeting Natives. The importance and yet ultimate artificiality of colonial storytelling in documenting the acquisition of \u201capproved\u201d scalps becomes clear when one considers the frequency of \u201cfraud,\u201d including grave robbing, and the fact that scalp-hunting raids were also slave-hunting raids (78\u201379).\n\nChapter 4 further demonstrates the power of narrativization in dehumanizing Indigenous people while serving the goals of colonization, by diving into fascinating and surprisingly numerous instances of scalping survivors and the stories they told in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century America. Despite the undeniable involvement of colonists in the collecting of scalps, \u201caccounts by colonial observers portrayed it as a distinctively Indigenous form of violence\u201d (93). Mirroring the diversity of meanings attributed to cross-cultural tattoos, modified settler-colonial bodies that bore the scars of their close encounter with scalping were subject to varying interpretations\u2014\u201cas honorable war wounds, a sign of Providence, a shameful mark of the community\u2019s failure to protect its own, or an uncertain mingling of all of the above\u201d (95). At the border between biology and culture, scalps and scalping wounds offer insights into the increasing racialization of difference (104) and settler-colonial fears of being transformed by their contact with Indigenous others (111).\n\nOdle has written a thought-provoking book that engages with a layered kind of colonial violence, one grounded in the transformation rather than the destruction of bodies, which included physical wounds as well as the metaphorical violence of erasure enacted through the stories colonists built around tattoos and scalps. Because this slim volume mostly focuses on settler-colonial perceptions, reappropriations, and selective narrativization of these two practices, readers will need to look elsewhere for a more comprehensive analysis of the ethnographic origins and meanings of tattooing and scalping for various Eastern North American communities. The volume-rich grounding in theoretical approaches of the subaltern body and the commodification of people through emerging racial thought makes it a very engaging starting point for anyone interested in further investigating the embodied dimensions of colonialism. Accessible prose, excellent illustrations, and fascinating collections of historical anecdotes and characters finish to make it an essential read."
