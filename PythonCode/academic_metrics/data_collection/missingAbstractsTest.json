Eastern Red-backed Salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, are often used as indicators of habitat quality in eastern North American forests. Most of the research concerning growth in this species has focused on the influence of body size, rather than on other external or temporal factors that might affect growth. We performed a mark\u2013recapture study spanning multiple years and seasons to compare the growth of individuals of P. cinereus across temporally variable environmental conditions. Unsurprisingly, the most significant factor affecting growth was body size. Growth also varied seasonally and annually, with greater growth of salamanders during a mild winter and more growth in 2014 than 2013. Sex-age class did interact with yearly fluctuations as evidenced by juveniles, but not adults, having reduced growth in 2014. However, color morph did not have an effect on growth. We concluded that fluctuating environmental conditions, as well as body size, exerted effects on the salamanders' growth. This study adds to our understanding of the factors affecting growth in terrestrial salamanders and provides context for past and future studies of body size and abundance in this ecologically important species.",

The study of American anarchism has remained on the margins for too long even with the impact of the new social history. The more we learn about the anarchist movement the more enduring its seemingly modest footprint turns out to be, a process of discovery set in motion by the late Paul Avrich, the pioneer historian of the field. Kenyon Zimmer\u2019s *Immigrants against the State* embodies and extends Avrich\u2019s legacy by investigating anarchist history within the fields of labor and migration history. Zimmer asks, \u201cHow and why did thousands of immigrants become anarchists?\u201d (2). In answering this question, Zimmer\u2019s excellent narrative does three important things of which labor and immigration historians do well to take notice.\"\n\nThis excerpt captures the essence of the research discussed in the article.",

After studying pairs, participants completed associative and item recognition tests. Older adults\u2019 responses were slower than younger adults\u2019 and associative recognition responses were slower than item recognition. However, for accuracy, there were no differences between age group or test type (item vs. associative), contrary to the expectations of the associate deficit hypothesis. Analysis of the EEG recordings indicated that, at parietal electrode sites, peak amplitudes were significantly larger in response to the associative recognition test compared to the item recognition test. Additionally, a significant 3-way interaction was observed at electrode Cz. The item recognition task elicited larger peak amplitudes to new test items compared to old test items in both age groups. Interestingly, while the associate recognition test also elicited larger peak amplitudes to new and rearranged test pairs as compared to old test pairs in younger adults, this difference did not exist for older adults. Implications for memory training of older adults will be discussed.",
    "10.1670/16-185": "Color polymorphism is common in many species, and color morph frequency is affected by differences in ecological and evolutionary pressures on each color morph. *Plethodon cinereus*, the Red-Backed Salamander, has two common color morphs, striped and unstriped, that vary in frequency among populations. *Plethodon cinereus* color morphs differ in their escape behaviors when exposed to predators and in their tail autotomization rates; this may result from differential predation. Although these previous studies indirectly implicated differential predation, we directly tested the hypothesis that color morphs differed in survival and whether one morph was depredated at a higher rate. We determined the survival of each color morph over 3 yr with the use of mark\u2013recapture data. We first compared frequencies of color morphs in juveniles and adults, and then estimated whether color morphs had different survival rates with the statistical program MARK. We found that frequency of striped salamanders was lower in adults than in juveniles, implying that fewer striped individuals survived to adulthood. In addition, color and age best explained survival probability during spring, but not fall, seasons. To test the effects of color morph on predation experimentally, we used clay models to determine the effects of avian and mammalian predators. We found more attacks on striped clay models by avian predators compared to the unstriped models, but we found no difference in attacks by mammals. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that there is differential predation in *P. cinereus*, with more predation on, and lower survival in, the striped morph.",

Natural history observations and published data are equivocal on whether frosted elfin caterpillars pupate below or above the soil surface, and some evidence suggests that pupation sites differ for caterpillars that feed on lupine (Lupinus spp.) versus wild indigo (Baptisia spp.). Pupation site has important implications for management because pupae located beneath the soil surface will likely be afforded greater protection from fire than those above the soil surface. Our study of both lupine- and indigo-feeding larvae at a single site in Worcester County, Maryland, found that pupation occurs above the soil surface in the leaf litter 92% of the time, and does not differ significantly with food plant preference. We recommend that land managers using prescribed fire as a habitat management tool for frosted elfin habitat assume some level of pupal mortality in burned areas and utilize a rotational burn schedule that maintains areas of unburned refugia in high-density elfin areas. We also recommend that managers try to establish a metapopulation structure for frosted elfin to address the possibility of natural occurring fires.\"",
    "10.1093/ahr/rhy562": "Recent studies on Muslim Spain, or al-Andalus, are continuing the trend away from exceptionalist approaches and moving toward approaches that situate Andalusi history within larger cultural and geographical contexts. Jessica A. Coope\u2019s *The Most Noble of People: Religious, Ethnic, and Gender Identity in Muslim Spain* is a welcome addition to this \u201clarger-than-al-Andalus\u201d approach, alongside works like Janina M. Safran\u2019s *Defining Boundaries in al-Andalus: Muslims, Christians, and Jews in Islamic Iberia* (2013) and Brian Catlos\u2019s *Kingdoms of Faith: A New History of Islamic Spain* (2018); all of these are examples of this trend, as they examine Andalusi history against the backdrop of developments in North Africa, the Islamic East, and the Mediterranean at large.\n\nIn *The Most Noble of People*, Coope studies the tensions surrounding religious, ethnic, and gender identities during the Umayyad period\u2014that is, from the mid-eighth century to the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate and the beginning of the Taifa period in 1031.\n\nThe title of Coope\u2019s book is a reference to a verse from the Qur\u02be\u0101n (49:13), in which God is said to prefer the noblest people among his creation, regardless of ethnicity\u2014a verse that some medieval commentators took to mean that Arab lineage alone did not make someone worthier in the eyes of God. This distinction between Arab and non-Arab Muslims lies at the center of Coope\u2019s analysis.\n\nShe argues that during this period, the Umayyad elite articulated an identity for themselves that conflated Arab with Muslim identity, to the exclusion of the non-Arab majority population over which they ruled. And while the terms of exclusion would have seemed rigid enough\u2014if you were not an Arab Muslim you could not be a member of the elite\u2014Coope contends that Arab identity was relative and negotiable.\n\nTo claim Muslim identity required conversion, unless one\u2019s father were a Muslim, in which case the person in question would also be legally considered a Muslim. To claim Arab identity required more ingenuity. Coope identifies two main strategies to do so: through one\u2019s lineage, and through one\u2019s proficiency in Arabic language and literature. Barring a credible claim to Arab descent (and fabricated genealogies were not unknown), mastery of Arabic language and literature conferred what Coope calls an \u201chonorary Arab identity\u201d to certain Iberian Muslims.\n\nBy the mid-tenth century, and as more and more of the Andalusi population converted to Islam\u2014and here Coope follows Richard W. Bulliet\u2019s \u201cconversion curve\u201d in *Conversion to Islam in the Medieval Period: An Essay in Quantitative History* (1979)\u2014Muslim identity became less contentious. Similarly, and despite the political fragmentation of the Taifa period, Coope argues that, at least from the viewpoint of identity, whether or not one was an Arab ceased to be a matter of consequence (the polemical anti-Arab *Ris\u0101la* of Ibn Garc\u00eda is not indicative of widespread tensions between Arabs and non-Arabs, in Coope\u2019s opinion).\n\nFor Coope, then, the tensions surrounding religious and ethnic identity were \u201cresolved\u201d with the downfall of the Umayyads. Yet gender identity followed a different path. By examining Islamic and Visigothic legal texts, Coope posits the pros and cons of conversion to Islam for Christian women. While the laws contained similar marriage provisions (viz., dower was necessary and remained in the wife\u2019s control, a woman\u2019s father had the power to arrange marriage, and there was a waiting period to remarry), in the realms of inheritance and public modesty, Muslim status represented a step down. For example, in Visigothic law, sons and daughters inherited equally and there was no distinction between cognatic and agnatic kin for inheritance purposes, whereas in shari\u02bfa this distinction enabled male relatives to question a woman\u2019s inheritance.\n\nIn an interesting comparison, Coope argues that the overall diminished legal status of Muslim women was similar to the status of non-Muslims, or *dhimm\u012bs*. Conversion would make it possible for a free man to become a fully capable agent in shari\u02bfa. The same was not the case for women, which leads the author to conclude that tensions surrounding gender identity continued after 1031.\n\nCoope\u2019s examination of gender identity alongside religious, ethnic, and cultural identity is commendable, although available sources dealing with gender identity are not only more limited but also lack direct accounts by women. In addition to well-known legal, polemical, and literary texts\u2014and the prolific Ibn \u1e24azm occupies a central place in Coope\u2019s analysis\u2014the author taps another valuable, less-utilized resource: mystical writings. The work of the influential Sufi writer Ibn \u02bfArab\u012b, who died in 1240 and therefore postdates the period in question, reveals a view of the masculine and feminine genders that is more complementary than the one prescribed by shari\u02bfa.\n\nCoope classifies sources between what we may call \u201cideological\u201d sources (legal, polemical, literary, mystical texts) and sources that, as she puts it, reflect \u201cactual treatment\u201d of Muslim women; however, this classification is misleading. The handful of collections of notarial formulas, fatwas, and shari\u02bfa lawsuits that have survived opens up avenues of inquiry both exciting and challenging. A model of a marriage contract found in Ibn al-\u02bfA\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101r\u2019s notarial formulary contains stipulations that effectively limited the range of prerogatives that shari\u02bfa prescribed for husbands, including the right to take a second wife or to move place of residence without consent. While Coope is right to signal the discrepancies between these sources and shari\u02bfa, the assertion that the former sources reflect actual treatment seems far-fetched.\n\nCoope\u2019s analysis of the volatile relationships between Umayyad rulers and several prominent non-Arab families is one of the most fascinating parts of the book. The case studies on the Ban\u016b Dh\u012b al-N\u016bn, \u02bfUmar ibn \u1e24af\u1e63\u016bn\u2019s family, and the Ban\u016b Qas\u012b are rich, vivid in their portrayal, and illustrate, in a way that prescriptive sources can only do obliquely, the complexity of studying identity.\n\nIn general Coope\u2019s treatment of the sources is evenhanded; she reviews the pitfalls of every text in a clear, informative manner, and she translates most Arabic words into English and explains the uses and meanings of a few of the most important concepts. This is a readable volume that will be of interest to those studying identity in premodern multicultural contexts and could potentially be assigned to advanced students.",

Her book joins a number of recent publications, such as those by Jasmine Nichole Cobb, Darcy Grimaldo Grigsby, and coeditors John Stauffer, Zoe Trodd, and Celeste-Marie Bernier, which have increased our understanding of images\u2019 political and cultural influence during the nineteenth century. Cutter writes against the notion that images denied enslaved people different modes of agency. Instead, as she demonstrates in five chronological chapters, images conveyed enslaved people\u2019s resistance and rejected ways of seeing that primarily cast them as abject Others.\n\nThroughout her book, Cutter studies numerous methods by which illustrated texts ideally encouraged their readers/viewers toward what she terms *parallel empathy*, a form of \u201cempathy that asserts concordance between a viewing reader and the enslaved\u201d (xi). This guiding concept frames her analysis of book illustrations, cartoons, pamphlets, household wares, and contemporary art pieces. Indeed, one of the strengths of Cutter\u2019s book is the reproduction and examination of more than one hundred images. The resulting collection of images both highlights Cutter\u2019s extensive research and provides an archive of images that scholars can draw on for future research. Weaving together the theories and practice of visual studies, literary studies, graphic narrative studies, sentimental aesthetics, and affect theory, Cutter poses a question that she answers throughout her book: \u201c[H]ow do words and images used together interpellate a reader, ask, demand, or entreat that he or she enter the ideology of the text and of the antislavery movement?\u201d (21).",

In 2012\u20132014, we conducted point counts at locations previously surveyed in 1981\u20131983 and analysed Breeding Bird Atlas data from 1980\u20132013 to estimate long-term population trends of two declining ground-nesting warblers on the Eastern Shore of Maryland within the Atlantic Coastal Plain: the Ovenbird *Seiurus aurocapilla* and the Worm-eating Warbler *Helmitheros vermivorum*. We detected significant declines for Ovenbirds in both datasets, but we found conflicting data for Worm-eating Warblers. During 2012\u20132015, we investigated the effects of forest characteristics, such as vegetative composition and ground cover, on occupancy and nest success. Ovenbirds were found more where there were more and larger trees but were negatively affected by the proportion of pines, whereas Worm-eating Warblers were more abundant when there were higher numbers of trees and more pines. Nest success was not affected by vegetation other than the proportion of pine trees or leaf litter depth, both of which increased nest success. Worm-eating Warblers with more pine needles in their nests also had increased nest success. This study presents a nuanced view of how forest composition (proportion of pine trees) of the Atlantic Coastal Plain in Maryland influenced ground-nesting warblers differently, and suggests that effectively managing ground-nesting warblers in this area may differ from other regions of Eastern North America due to its unique vegetative composition, structure, and history.",

Impressively rich historical context enlivens the neighborhoods, populations, and venues that helped sustain a lively and contentious theater scene. Sustaining the rivalries between Anglophone and Francophone populations was a shifting desire to preserve the French language and colonial cultures and to increase pressure on developing American and Louisianan identities. In *Creole Drama*, Juliane Braun successfully demonstrates that her study \u201creintegrates non-English-speaking societies and their cultural production into the field of American literary and cultural studies\u201d (p. 7). In this endeavor she aligns herself with scholars such as Lawrence A. Rosenwald and Werner Sollors while also providing a bridge between the scholarship on New Orleans and early American theater by scholars including Shirley Thompson, Jeffrey Richards, and Heather S. Nathans.\n\nThe book begins by highlighting the deep connections between New Orleans and the French Caribbean. Spanish colonial officials noticed the strong community created by the movement of actors, singers, musicians, and dramatic productions to New Orleans. As a result, the Spanish colonial administration censored the Francophone New Orleans theater because it fostered revolutionary ideas and celebrated French empirical bonds. When Anglophone theaters later competed for dominance in the Crescent City, Francophone theater's references to French empirical cultures became one strategy for cultural survival. Black theater later survived by sidestepping an 1830 censorship law and staged plays that likely critiqued the system of pla\u00e7age and the leadership of Haitian president Jean-Pierre Boyer, though stronger evidence would prove this. Braun's analysis of the Crescent City's free black population's engagement with Latin American emigration is convincing. The vivid context that surveys the effects of the Haitian Revolution (1791\u20131804) and the changing New Orleans neighborhoods shines in the book. The fourth, and perhaps strongest, chapter examines French speakers\u2019 claims to American national identity as the U.S. government pushed for war with Mexico. The theater, Braun argues, became a site to claim American belonging and renounce the history and alleged threat of monarchy. Here, theater's engagement with struggles between groups from different linguistic, cultural, racial, and birthplace backgrounds coalesce skillfully. The book ends with the playwright Victor S\u00e9jour's engagement in debates over slavery, emancipation, and the status of free black people in the Atlantic world. This adds to the book's theme of cultural exchange and intervention by showing that he \u201cevaluated the lessons [of] prior emancipations in Haiti, France, and the British West Indies\u201d in his cultural production (p. 153).\n\nWithin the text, Braun points to potential avenues of scholarly research, though a few could be added. Strong is the case for \u201cstruggles over political and cultural sovereignty\u201d reflected in playhouses, but how did the playhouses, in turn, affect these struggles (p. 9)? This multidirectional flow of cause and effect would deeply enrich this study. Additionally, a fuller investigation of the plays\u2019 reception would help reveal the effects of theater. The unexplained disappearance of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Marigny would enhance this study, as would more evidence that \u201cIndian populations escaped the official racial gaze\u201d in New Orleans is needed (p. 101).\n\nBraun's study of cultural exchanges and interventions smartly incorporates the contributions of non-Anglophone groups into the larger body of American literary and cultural studies. It widens and extends the path for other researchers in these areas.",

Ubiquitination involves the attachment of the small polypeptide ubiquitin to target proteins to control their activity or stability. As a reversible modification, E3 ubiquitin-ligases attach ubiquitin to proteins while deubiquitinases (DUBs) remove ubiquitin from tagged proteins. Revealing the mechanisms that regulate ubiquitination/deubiquitination is important for understanding how cells fine-tune protein activity to control important processes and pathways. It is clear in animals and yeast that WD-repeat proteins (WDR) bind to and activate DUBs. In plants, however, no interactions between WDR proteins and DUBs have been reported. Here, we used BLAST searches to identify plant homolog proteins of a conserved animal DUB and its associated WDR proteins. Based on these homologies, we predicted that Arabidopsis UBP3, a DUB involved in pollen development and transmission, forms a complex with the WDR proteins At2g37160 and LRS1. Indeed, these three proteins could be co-immunoprecipitated when transiently co-expressed as epitope-tagged proteins in plant cells. At2g37160 also interacted with UBP3 in the yeast two-hybrid system and could enhance the DUB activity of UBP3 ten-fold in vitro. These results provide the first evidence that plant DUBs, like animal DUBs, are regulated by WDR proteins.",

No difference was found when comparing total abundances of dung beetles sampled from NCU and CU farms. There was, however, a consistent significant effect of month across multiple dominant species. Using Random Forests analyses, we determined site location, soil type, and chemical lethality as additional important predictor variables affecting dung beetle abundances on Maryland farms.

Numerous students, faculty, librarians, scholars, and researchers have identified more than two hundred state, regional, and national Colored Conventions that were held in the last seven decades of the nineteenth century. Those who use the project Web site will find scanned copies and/or transcriptions of the proceedings of these meetings that document the wide-ranging issues that concerned and motivated African American women and men during these decades. Not since Philip S. Foner and George E. Walker's 1986 edited collection, Proceedings of the Black National and State Conventions, 1865\u20131900, and Howard Holman Bell's books before that have Colored Conventions movement records been organized on such a large scale. This site surpasses those efforts. Many more conventions and related records have come to light and been made publicly accessible as a result of the collaboration between the site's team, educators, and members of the public who contribute suggestions, leads, and documents. It is an essential resource for researching or teaching any project related to the Colored Conventions movement.\"",

    "10.1093/ahr/rhab630": "Sixteenth-century colonial enterprises continue to occupy a marginal place in the historiography and teaching surveys of early America. Heather Martel\u2019s *Deadly Virtue: Fort Caroline and the Early Protestant Roots of American Whiteness* is a welcome addition to the literature on the failed French Huguenot attempt to settle Florida in the early 1560s and some of the transnational consequences of the violent destruction of the colony by the Spanish in 1565. Martel\u2019s work brings refreshing insights to this historical episode through a staunch focus on sexuality, gender, and identity, and a commitment to unraveling the long-term roots of Protestant settler-colonialism and the ultimate rise of a racialized and cis-patriarchal society in English North America. As the book\u2019s subtitle suggests, the significance of the French disaster in Florida primarily resides, for Martel, in its role as a cautionary tale that contributed to the solidification of a definition of Protestant \u201cvirtue\u201d that ought to be protected from the threat of corruption by seductive Natives. That Calvinist \u201cvirtue,\u201d she asserts, \u201cwould later become whiteness\u201d (16) and should be understood as an \u201cimportant precursor to biogenetic racism\u201d (17).\n\nRather than placing Fort Caroline in the context and literature of the French colonial Atlantic, Martel thus depicts French Huguenots as pioneers in a transnational Calvinist movement to settle America, which she connects to seventeenth-century New England colonies, an intellectual leap she achieves by glossing over important nuances between iterations of the Calvinist and Lutheran doctrines and some questionable lack of historicization. That approach shapes her source base: next to the standard firsthand accounts (mostly in translation) by French participants such as Ren\u00e9 de Laudonni\u00e8re, Jean Ribault, Nicolas Le Challeux, and Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues, Martel relies on the English translations, commentaries, and artistic representations published by Theodor de Bry, Thomas Harriot, John Hawkins, and Richard Hakluyt. Taking an unapologetically postmodern stance, Martel considers these various sources equally unreliable about ethnographic details (\u201cvoyeuristic fictional representations\u201d [128]), but insightful in terms of French and English Calvinist colonizing sensitivities. While her argumentation at times flirts with the teleological, the main contribution of the book is in the attention it brings to the transnational connections and historical contingencies that brought about the brand of exploitive and exclusionary settler-state treatment of Indigenous peoples characteristic of later Anglo-America.\n\nThe ways in which early French settlers experienced their encounter with the land of Florida and its Indigenous inhabitants were profoundly shaped by humoral theory, according to which human bodies and souls were deeply and visibly subject to transformations from their cultural and natural environments. The author uses humoralism as a core interpretive lens to uncover the entanglements of sexuality, faith, identity, and colonial strategies through seven thematic, short, and engaging chapters: \u201cFriendship,\u201d \u201cHealth,\u201d \u201cPower,\u201d \u201cGender,\u201d \u201cSexuality,\u201d \u201cIdolatry,\u201d and \u201cGrace,\u201d with a conclusion making inroads into \u201cRace.\u201d\n\nIn the first two chapters, Martel describes how early French colonizers, led by Laudonni\u00e8re, pursued a \u201cdiplomacy of love\u201d (19) toward the Indigenous people with whom they sought to establish long-term alliances for the success of their Calvinist haven. Through positive and \u201ceroticized\u201d (1) descriptions of the beauty and friendliness of their Indigenous hosts, French chroniclers sought to project the potential of their \u201cromantic friendship\u201d (18) to transform, convert, and civilize Indigenous Floridians. Believing in predestination, these early colonists also searched for visible signs of an Indigenous \u201celect\u201d among Native societies. Attracting Indigenous people through the beauty and perfection of their Christian morality justified efforts at accommodation as well as the use of deception and betrayals, and eventually resulted in increased French dependence on their allies. At risk of being reciprocally seduced and thus corrupted by the \u201callure\u201d (18, 20, 22) of Indigenous society and bodies, the Huguenots tried to protect themselves through hygienic practices and the judgments they placed on Indigenous ceremonies and appearances.\n\nIn chapter 3, Martel makes a bold claim: that the Huguenots who were fleeing religious violence at home entertained for a time the vision of an independent Calvinist kingdom under the dominion of a converted Indigenous leader, whom they believed to have found in Apalachy (Apalachee) King Houstaqua (15, 72\u201374). This and other Protestant-Indigenous alliances were ultimately compromised by the rise of hunger, mutiny, and interethnic violence in the colony. In the eyes of critics and English commentators, however, as convincingly argued in chapters 4 and 5, the real culprit for this downfall was the fact that the French had let power relations be reversed and succumbed to \u201cforbidden desire\u201d (116) toward their Indigenous hosts. In a world where bodies and sexual identities were considered mutable, Martel explains, \u201cpower relations could be considered both homoerotic and transgendered, with the subordinate slipping into effeminacy and the dependent role out of respect, love, and obedience toward the more masculine dominant\u201d (116). Chapter 7 offers a particularly perceptive literary analysis of providential Protestant theology in three survivors\u2019 accounts of the Spanish attack on the colony. *Deadly Virtue* repeatedly implies that de Bry\u2019s publications played an important role in the circulation of the gendered lessons learned from the Fort Caroline fiasco in the English-speaking world, resulting in the determination by Calvinists \u201cto isolate themselves from the wilderness, idolatry, and licentiousness and disciplining members of their communities who were not graced\u201d (172).\n\nThis thought-provoking book will frustrate some historians as much as it stimulates others. The author\u2019s choice not to engage with French colonial and Atlantic historiography prevents her from addressing the notable fact that French Catholics famously pursued a similar policy of acculturation in many other regions throughout the Americas, well into the eighteenth century. Among numerous other regrettable gaps in the bibliography, Ca\u00f1izares-Esguerra\u2019s *Puritan Conquistadores: Iberianizing the Atlantic, 1550\u20131700* (2006) would have helped refine the idea that humoral science was peculiarly tied to a young brand of Calvinism. This is, perhaps, less a failing in the methodology of the book than a symptom of enduring disciplinary compartmentalization. More problematic is Martel\u2019s refusal to identify by name the Indigenous groups that bore the brunt of French settler-colonialism, which has consequences not only for the texture of her analyses but also for descendant communities seeking recognition, such as the Timucuas. How might Martel\u2019s points about Huguenot commentaries on \u201chermaphrodites\u201d (104), for instance, have been complicated by the inclusion of Indigenous captivity practices many scholars have uncovered in recent years? How might her description of the vomiting ceremonies criticized by Protestants as excessive hygienic behaviors (54\u201355) been enriched by the knowledge that the emetic \u201cblack drink\u201d they referenced ties into the Mississippian political and spiritual heritage of southeastern Indigenous people? Nevertheless, with its numerous illustrations, important connections to current concerns about race and gender, and clear explanations of complex early modern concepts, *Deadly Virtue* will certainly foster valuable conversations in the undergraduate classroom, especially if paired with scholarship that provides more Indigenous voices and perspectives.",
    "10.1093/ahr/rhab329": "The abstract extracted from the provided HTML is as follows:\n\nThe field of medieval Iberian studies, once dominated in the United States by the *Reconquista* and *Convivencia* paradigms, has opened to new avenues of inquiry in recent years (e.g., Christian royal women\u2019s power and authority), while on the other side of the Atlantic, feudalism and the restructuring of agrarian societies and landscapes remain strong methodological frameworks. Straddling these trends but decidedly charting its own course is the book under review. *Victory\u2019s Shadow* is a political history of medieval Catalonia. Situated on the northeastern corner of the Iberian Peninsula, Catalonia formed a constellation of rival counties until its most powerful county, that of Barcelona, united with the royal house of Aragon in the early twelfth century to form the composite monarchy known as the Crown of Aragon\u2014a key player in Spain\u2019s medieval history.\n\n*Victory\u2019s Shadow* focuses on the establishment of comital, and later comital-royal, authority over New Catalonia (Lleida and Tortosa), by examining what the author calls the cycles of conquest, delegation to lords, seigniorial aggrandizement, and domain recuperation from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries. (The Lower Aragon region, despite being part of the Crown of Aragon and experiencing similar cycles, does not receive much attention.) Barton argues that victory in conquest did not necessarily translate into successful governance but was hampered by the inability of counts and count-kings to consolidate and centralize their power over conquered territories. The rulers\u2019 need to delegate conquered lands to nobles illustrates this governmental failure\u2014the shadow to their victory. Rather than a progressive expansion of the core\u2019s institutions and customs into peripheral conquered territories, as Robert Bartlett envisioned for medieval Europe in *The Making of the Twelfth Century: Conquest, Colonization, and Cultural Change* (1993), Barton\u2019s study of high medieval Catalonia reveals great heterogeneity in forms of land tenure, jurisdiction, customary traditions, peasant conditions, and treatment of Jewish and Muslim minorities.\n\nThe book is divided into three chronological parts. Completing the volume are several helpful maps (although, the captions for maps 3 and 4 are mismatched) and rulers\u2019 genealogical trees. Part 1, \u201cInteraction and Conquest,\u201d examines the shifting relationship between Christian and Muslim rulers in the northeastern borderlands following the caliphate\u2019s disintegration (chap. 1), the competition between the kings of Aragon and the counts of Barcelona and Urgell over the Andalusi Upper Frontier (chap. 2), and the momentous Barcelona-Aragon union and its impact on the count and now prince Ramon Berenguer IV\u2019s expansionist campaign, which ultimately led to the capture of Tortosa in 1148 and Lleida\u2019s surrender a year later. The adroit political maneuvering of the counts of Urgell, sandwiched between expansionist Aragon and Barcelona, is amply expounded throughout the book, as is the continued papal involvement in shaping the frontier, alongside Trans-Pyrenean, Pisan, and Genoese actors.\n\nPart 2, \u201cThe Implications of Victory,\u201d focuses on the consolidation process during the reigns of Ramon Berenguer IV and his successors, count-kings Alfons I and Pere I. Whereas, as Barton argues, Ramon Berenguer IV had a balanced conquest-consolidation policy over New Catalonia despite the jurisdictional wrangling that ensued over preconquest pledges to allies (chap. 4), Alfons struggled with expansion and a barely self-sufficient Lower Ebro region, while his son Pere, caught between trans-Pyrenean, Peninsular, and Mediterranean interests, buried himself in debt, pawning off comital-royal rights in Tortosa along the way (chap. 5). The approach to Lleida, however, was different, as count-kings were invested in making this territory a part of their patrimony (chap. 6).\n\nLastly, Part 3, \u201cNew Catalonia after Valencia,\u201d examines territorial expansion over Mallorca and Valencia and the strengthening of comital-royal authority during Jaume I\u2019s reign (1213\u201376), which was more often than not met with resistance by the barons, whose actions Barton describes as \u201cinsidious\u201d and \u201cobstreperous\u201d (224\u201325), unwittingly adopting the ruler\u2019s perspective (chap. 7). Chapter 8 delves into the fascinating contentious border between Aragon and Catalonia, with parties vigorously debating whether the Cinca River (approximately eighteen miles west of Lleida) or the Segre River (which crosses Lleida) constituted the boundary line. Contrary to the nationalist historiographic dictum that Lleida is as Catalonian as can be, Barton reveals a degree of shared culture between Aragon and Catalonia in the curious complaint of some Lleida residents against Jaume I\u2019s assignment of Lleida to Catalonia in 1244 (260).\n\nEspecially commendable in this book is Barton\u2019s painstaking scrutiny of hundreds of agreements between the counts and count-kings and other lords known as *convenientiae*. A case in point is the detailed study of the deal making that followed the 1209 death of Count Ermengol VIII; the count died without a male heir, and the book highlights the subsequent efforts of his daughter, Aurembiaix, one of the very few women that populates this book, to make good on her father\u2019s will. In this case and others, the author reads carefully between the lines to discern the parties\u2019 motivations, and precisely how in every instance each relationship played a role in the rulers\u2019 designs for the Crown.\n\nOn the question of designs, Barton treads unstable terrain. A question that frames this book is, \u201cDid \u2026 territorial accumulation facilitate further centralization throughout the conquering regime \u2026 ?\u201d (7). The short answer would be no, for, as Barton argues, the monarchy failed \u201cto implement its emerging sovereign ideology and to apply sophisticated, efficacious techniques of consolidation\u201d (5). Despite its enduring historiographical tradition, this approach seems problematic, as it sets rulers up for failure. In expecting the governance of Ramon Berenguer IV and his immediate successors to measure up against Jaume I\u2019s centralizing reign, we find twelfth-century rulers sorely lacking. A more fruitful approach would be to envision the political landscape of this period as a \u201ccluster of [competing] lordships\u201d (7), which might help reevaluate the county of Barcelona\u2019s evolving history as one among many contending for power, not as a prefiguration of the Crown of Aragon in the late thirteenth century. These remarks notwithstanding, *Victory\u2019s Shadow* is an important contribution to the field, of interest also to those studying multicultural frontiers in the medieval period and beyond.",
    "10.1242/jeb.236877": "When you picture a fish that spends its whole life constantly swimming at high speed, you probably see a tuna or marlin \u2013 something that cruises miles and miles each day through the open ocean. These fish generally have crescent-shaped tails with a narrow caudal peduncle \u2013 the part of the fish tail just before the tail fin \u2013 built for efficient swimming 24/7. However, fish living in fast-flowing rivers also need to swim fast constantly to be successful. The main difference from their deep-sea counterparts is that these riverine fish are swimming as hard as they can to go nowhere; they are essentially on a giant water treadmill. Living in torrential rapids, these fish need specialized traits to help them swim all day just to stay in the same spot, a behavior known as station-holding, to avoid getting washed downstream. Are the adaptations for swimming constantly in a flowing river to station-hold like those for roaming the relatively calm open ocean at speed?\n\nTo find out, a group of scientists from Northern Arizona University, USA, led by Daniel Kimball in Alice Gibb's lab, looked at the tail anatomy of three species of minnow from the southwestern USA to compare with that of tuna and other open ocean cruisers. These closely related minnows \u2013 bonytail, humpback chub and roundtail chub, listed in descending order of flow preference \u2013 are some of the species that traverse the world-famous rapids of the Colorado River as it passes through the Grand Canyon. Building on previous work, Kimball and colleagues found that not only does the bonytail have spines for muscle attachment on its vertebral column, which insert at sharper angles than for your typical fish, but the angle of these spines gets shallower from head to tail. This makes its caudal peduncle much thinner and more streamlined than those of most other fish, independently evolving the same shape as the tuna tail, despite being completely unrelated. Meanwhile, the slower-water preferring roundtail chub had more obtuse vertebral spines with a thicker, more typical tail shape.\n\nTails are more than just bones, though. How does the bonytail's tail muscles and connective tissues compare with those of tuna and other oceanic speedy species that prefer slower moving water? Kimball and colleagues tried stretching the muscles that move the minnows\u2019 tails to find out how much force they can withstand. They also measured how much collagen, a tough connective tissue, was found in these muscles by examining them under a microscope. The team found that the tail muscles of the bonytail resisted tearing better than those of the other species, with roundtail chub having the least tear-resistant muscles. This means that compared with its lazier, though still relatively active relatives, the bonytail can safely transmit a lot more force through its tail to propel itself through fast-flowing rapids. Additionally, the team found that the muscles powering the bonytail's tail had more collagen than its other muscles, which was not seen in the other species. This suggests their tail muscles may act like the springy tendons of tuna tails, storing elastic energy on each tail movement, allowing bonytails to swim efficiently at high speeds.\n\nWhile there may not be any freshwater tuna, bonytails come as close as possible thanks to convergent evolution allowing both species to arrive at the same solution for high performance swimming. However, instead of swimming non-stop to cross entire oceans, bonytails swim non-stop just to stay still in fast-flowing rivers. Like a cross-country runner on a treadmill, the bonytail could cruise through the oceans with tunas if they wanted to, but prefer the scenic landscape of the Grand Canyon.",

PD tremors have a severe influence on patients' daily quality of life. Wearable technology can be used to help detect, quantify, and mitigate these PD tremors. Among the wearable technology, PD tremor detection is the primary step for further analysis and treatment using wearable devices. Some researchers have explored PD rest tremor detection. However, less research has been done concerning postural tremor and action tremor detection, which are difficult to classify only using frequency-domain features. In this paper, we propose TremorSense, a PD tremor detection system to classify Parkinson's Disease hand tremors. TremorSense utilizes accelerometers and gyroscopes as wearable sensors on patients' wrists to collect data from 30 PD patients. We develop the TremorSense Android application that connects the sensors via Bluetooth to save the data. Furthermore, we design an 8-Layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify PD rest, postural, and action tremors. We evaluate the CNN model with self-evaluation, cross-evaluation and leave-one-out evaluation, and the accuracies for all three evaluations are greater than 94%.\"",

The purpose of this study was to assess attitudes towards honey bees of adults visiting a honey bee information table at a University's weeklong pollinator event in the spring of 2019. Attitudes were assessed utilizing 12 statements scored on a 5-point Likert scale of strongly agree to strongly disagree. Relationships between demographics and attitudes were explored using chi-square test and Bonferroni correction. Attitudes towards honey bees were, overall, positive. Participants recognize the intelligence of honey bees and agree it is important to learn about honey bees, protect them, and that they are an important part of the environment. They disagreed that they felt fear when near a honey bee, and disagreed that it is better to kill a bee than be stung. Additionally, they disagreed that they would kill a honey bee found in their home. Participants strongly disagreed that honey bees are dangerous. Significant relationships were found between number of times a person was stung and attitudes towards learning about honey bees and whether a person felt that killing a honey bee is better than being stung. A significant relationship was also found between geographic location and importance of honey bees to the environment. This study highlighted the need to continue education and exposure of the public to honey bees in order to positively affect perceptions.\"",

This project aims to study and develop image processing and machine learning algorithms to segment and track the size of the tumor regions affected by the anti-cancer bacteria based on the diffusion-weighted MRI images (DWI) collected from animal tumor models over the course of treatment, providing methods of evaluating its effectiveness. We employ emerging image processing and machine learning techniques that are implemented in MATLAB and Python to create algorithms consisting of pre-processing, processing, and post-processing steps, with the goal of calculating the destructed tumor tissue volume at each stage of the treatment. To automate the pre-processing and identification steps of the tumor region, a convolutional neural network called a U-Net is utilized to predict a binary mask to identify and crop the raw MRI images around the tumor prior to the processing and the post-processing steps, then the algorithm calculates the total volume of the tumor, dead tissue, and live tissue. The U-Net is trained using binary masks of the tumor regions alongside the original MRI images. The developed algorithms allow researchers to quantitatively determine the effectiveness of the BBCT by tracking the volume of dead tumor tissues. Ultimately, this research could lead to an automated 3D volumetric tumor tissue destruction measured in vivo longitudinally in the DWI experiments.",

For habitat data, water quality measurements were recorded once per trapping session, while canopy cover and vegetation data were recorded once per field season. We also investigated niche overlap in habitat and food resources between C. guttata and other, more common, turtle species. Our data indicated that the abundance of C. guttata was negatively correlated with dissolved O2 and pH levels and positively correlated with body of water depth and canopy cover. The investigation of niche overlap revealed that Mud Turtles (Kinosternon subrubrum) and Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta), but not Snapping Turtles (Chelydra serpentina), were negatively correlated with the abundance of C. guttata despite differences in characteristics of bodies of water used by each species. We used structural equation modeling to better understand if the relationships between C. guttata and other turtles were due to direct interactions or simply reflected environmental influences. We then used stable isotope analyses to compare similarities in \u03b413C and \u03b415N isotopes as proxies for diet overlap between C. guttata and other turtles and ultimately found that all species had similar, broad diets. The inverse relationship between abundance of C. guttata and other species, paired with the overlap in dietary niche space, suggests there is potential for interspecific interactions to negatively impact the abundance of C. guttata within turtle communities on the Atlantic Coastal Plain.

Ambystoma t. tigrinum breed in ephemeral freshwater ponds and then migrate into the surrounding terrestrial environment after metamorphosis. Limited research exists about what habitat characteristics play a role in breeding pond use. We sought to understand what features of the breeding pond and surrounding landscape influence abundance and occupancy. We measured salamander occupancy, salamander abundance, and water quality parameters at ponds during the 2018 and 2019 breeding seasons. We used geographic information systems to determine pond area and the percentage of forest area and road density surrounding a pond at four spatial scales. Pond occupancy by A. t. tigrinum was positively associated with increased depth and less forest cover at the largest spatial scales. Abundance of A. t. tigrinum was greatest in larger, deeper ponds, potentially because these factors increase hydroperiod. More basic pH and decreased conductivity were also associated with higher male salamander abundances in ponds. Forest area and road density were not in the top-ranked model, although we note that ponds in this study had a minimum of 70% forest area within 150 m.

Although the study is limited to this case, the author demonstrates how these organizations differ despite serving overlapping constituencies and facing similar political hazards. He seeks to explain why some organizations effectively empower poor, marginalized, and exploited populations while others weaken the struggle for justice, freedom, and abolitionist demands.\n\nForrest argues that social justice organizations encounter resistance from social, economic, and institutional forces seeking to displace, subvert, and destroy movements to abolish oppression. These factors include neoliberal ideology encouraging the marketization of public goods like education. Combined with demands placed on workers and individuals operating under capitalism, social justice organizations experience unequal participation and access to resources based on socioeconomic status. Like Martin Gilens argued in \"Affluence and Influence,\" the demands placed on workers and individuals under capitalism constrain the influence of social justice organizations creating inequalities in participation and resources based on socioeconomic status. Forrest convincingly argues that before the 2008 Great Recession, the Obama administration and local governments administered policies reflecting neoliberal values, prioritizing bailouts for financial institutions, corporations, and wealthy investors instead of policies to bail out low-income, Black, and disadvantaged communities. Marginalized communities became targets for financial institutions with high-interest subprime and otherwise predatory mortgage products.\n\nAs discussed in \"Race for Profit: How Banks and the Real Estate Industry Undermined Black Homeownership\" by Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, racial oppression that contributed to housing segregation, Black poverty, and reinforced institutional racism was replaced by government-insured mortgage-lending exploitation. Forrest provides a clearly articulated theory and compelling explanation of housing insecurity, education, poverty, and the fight for social justice. He contributes to this literature by discussing how predatory lending practices fueled the housing crisis, linking lasting and disproportionately high foreclosure rates among Black women to these pernicious practices. The disparities are politicized by framing the Black community as \u201cirresponsible borrowers.\u201d He effectively shows how this context (i.e., underfunded education systems, foreclosures, housing insecurity, and poverty) affected the goals and mobilization of social movement organizations.\n\nForrest contends that respectability politics and conventional rhetoric lead social justice organizations to diminish, obscure, and deny abolitionist demands. Like arguments presented during the Civil Rights era, many activists believe that the demands of social movements should be pragmatic and achieved through conventional political means. Contentious identities are fashioned to reject the stigmatization of targeted groups like Black women, low-income people, and working-class constituencies. Instead of operating on the basis of the assumption that Black people are irresponsible borrowers, effective social movements use adversarial contentious identities that challenge social ignorance. For instance, the author discussed how the Welfare Rights Committee combatted social ignorance by deploying etiquette, contentious identity, and rhetoric: \u201cIt problematized societal ignorance about the market-based system of oppression.\u201d\n\nThe need for authenticity and oppositional narratives that foreground abolitionist demands and raise awareness of injustice effectively challenged systems of oppression. In this book, Forrest has examined social justice organizations in a manner that clarifies the complexity of grassroots organizing. As scholars and activists continue to interrogate social problems linked to racism, housing insecurity, and the COVID crisis, this volume advances knowledge about social justice movements and inequality in America. Readers interested in understanding how organizations have effectively advocated for abolitionist demands will benefit from reading this book.",

The impact of such injuries on movements of freshwater turtles remains poorly understood. We tracked Spotted Turtles (*n* = 20) in a single population on the Delmarva Peninsula using radio telemetry for \u223c1 year. Seven turtles had at least 1 limb or foot completely amputated by a predator, and the remaining 13 were uninjured. When comparing movements among turtles, we found no difference in home-range sizes between male (*n* = 8) and female (*n* = 7) nor between injured (*n* = 7) and uninjured (*n* = 8) Spotted Turtles during their breeding season. However, injured turtles (*n* = 5) had smaller home ranges (mean \u00b1 SE = 0.26 \u00b1 0.14 ha) than uninjured turtles (*n* = 12, 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 ha) during the nonbreeding season, when turtles are more terrestrial. Our findings suggest a potential ecological cost of nonlethal injury, as predator effects might extend beyond simple mortality.",

    "10.1093/ahr/rhae266": "Writing Labor\u2019s Emancipation, Greg Hall\u2019s excellent biography of Jay Fox, traces the life of a forgotten activist who, after experiencing the Haymarket tragedy firsthand, dedicated his life to the cause of labor and the duty to educate through the printed word. Born in New Jersey to Irish parents\u2014he is mislabeled as \u201cIrish-born\u201d in some previous studies\u2014Fox followed the trajectory of most foreign-born workers who became anarchists. Contrary to stereotypes, the majority of immigrant anarchists radicalized after their arrival when confronted with the brutalities of American capitalism. It is one of Hall\u2019s arguments that Fox, too, became radicalized after experiencing the assault of a grinding and profoundly unfair economy that left millions of working families voiceless and trapped. Other than a labor activist, Fox was a journalist, printer, and a participant in the anarchist commune at Home, Washington. He witnessed the horror at Haymarket and the subsequent backlash against labor. Like many anarchists, he was involved in several free-speech fights and was indicted himself, leading to a conviction under the anti-anarchist laws enacted after President McKinley\u2019s assassination. His strong support for a more inclusive industrial unionism landed him at the 1905 founding convention of the Industrial Workers of the World.\n\nWriting Labor\u2019s Emancipation reveals a profoundly human story of a devoted radical who held differing philosophical and pragmatic ideas simultaneously. One of the strengths of Hall\u2019s study is showing how challenging it could be to marry anarchist principles to a commitment to organized labor in a greedy, industrializing society. Fox was a philosophical anarchist, but he debated and adopted various approaches as a trade unionist. First, he veered toward syndicalism, the idea that unions would replace corporate and state structures in a new society. In this sense, Fox was similar to the Chicago anarchist labor activists Albert Parsons and August Spies, who both need updated biographies in English. Fox was mainly active in trade unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, which challenges the historiography of the AFL in a small way. He helped found the IWW but criticized its dual unionism. In the wake of the Great War, Fox experienced another change of heart when he advocated that workers attain political power and join a labor party. From there, he became a communist and even supported the Bolsheviks, perhaps his most controversial decision. However, he continued to work on a history of anarchism, which he refused to repudiate. Hall\u2019s probing and sensitive portrait of Fox\u2019s political evolution contributes to an ongoing scholarly discussion centered around the interaction between anarchists and the post\u2013Civil War labor movement. There is an assumption within labor history that American anarchism from 1880 to 1920 was an extremist fringe phenomenon unmoored from the labor movement. This is an incomplete picture at best. Jay Fox\u2019s political and intellectual life testifies to the strong bond between anarchists, anarchist ideas, and the movement for labor emancipation, even after 1920. \u201cInfusing the labor movement with anarchism,\u201d argues Hall, \u201cwas his distinctive contribution as a radical, a revolutionary, and a unionist\u201d (40). Hall\u2019s biography contextualizes anarchists like Fox within the union movement the way James Green\u2019s Writing Revolution expanded our understanding of early labor activism.\n\nWriting Labor\u2019s Emancipation also contributes to our understanding of anarchist print culture, a vital component of a decentralized movement without political parties or electoral campaigns. One cannot overstate this point. The thousands of anarchist papers, bulletins, zines, and pamphlets printed and distributed in dozens of languages in the United States function as the fabric and forum of the movement and attest to its resilience and precariousness. Any assessment of the anarchist movement that fails to consult its own print sources and instead only uses official records and mainstream newspapers is not only inadequate but suspect. Through the printed and spoken word, anarchists like Fox broadcast a counternarrative that could jolt complacent minds into questioning received authority. Hall\u2019s other central argument is that writing and editing was Fox\u2019s \u201cprimary activity as an anarchist\u201d and that he exerted more influence with his pen than with his union card (61). Most anarchists believed that a printing press could stimulate a shared education and the spirit of solidarity that empowers the oppressed profoundly. Fox sought readership, not leadership (3). In this respect, Hall\u2019s book joins recent studies that expand our knowledge of anarchist print culture.\n\nThough Hall frequently mentions Fox\u2019s partners and daughter, readers may want more information about their individual lives and family dynamics, if sources exist. The discussion of Fox\u2019s occasional sexism and views on gender is crucial to providing a complete picture of a complicated personality and movement. More historians have started analyzing the anarchists\u2019 views on gender and race in the period of Jim Crow America, but more needs to be done. That said, Greg Hall has crafted a readable and impartial portrait of a deeply committed activist, enraged by the immiseration of labor, enthusiastic about labor\u2019s will to fight back, and committed to spreading ideas through independent media outlets.",
    "10.1093/ahr/rhae269": "Examples of hybridity in the areas of diplomacy, material culture, economic activities, and religion belied European colonists\u2019 stubborn efforts at claiming and enforcing ideological, physical, and spiritual separateness from Native peoples and cultures in Early America. Tattooing and scalping, two markedly Indigenous practices of body modification, elicited complicated and contradictory reactions from European and early American settler-colonists. Colonial authorities and individuals used elaborate scripting to come to terms with the uncomfortable reality that tattoos and scalps quickly became profoundly cross-cultural practices. Mairin Odle\u2019s sharply written *Under the Skin: Tattoos, Scalps, and the Contested Language of Bodies in Early America* fills an important gap in the existing literature, in which tattoos and scalps have typically been studied only tangentially to other topics, such as early intercultural encounters or imperial warfare. The author\u2019s critical choice of considering these two practices side by side, despite obvious differences in their purposes and sociopolitical contexts, allows her to develop a powerful argument about the embodied dimensions of settler-colonialism. *Under the Skin* convincingly shows that the contradictions and ambiguities surrounding colonial descriptions and practices of tattooing and scalping are revealing of the nature and contradictions of settler-colonialism itself. The volume is also notable for its piercing coverage of gendered dimensions of these two practices, despite their overwhelming association in colonial and modern imaginations with masculinity and war.\n\nA quick and stimulating read, the book is evenly split into two chapters focusing on tattoos and two chapters focusing on scalping, framed by an insightful introduction and epilogue.\n\nChapter 1 examines the first documented encounters between English colonial hopefuls and Indigenous tattooing, through the writings of Thomas Harriot and the accompanying watercolors of North Carolina Algonquians produced by John White in the late sixteenth century. Drawing on previous knowledge of pilgrimage tattoos and the markings of ancient Britons (Picts), colonial observers immediately conceptualized tattoos as \u201cwritten sign systems\u201d that could be deciphered and interpreted in order to identify specific Indigenous nations and meaningful hierarchies, with the ultimate goal of facilitating diplomacy and conquest. The terminology and cultural references used by Englishmen to make sense of Algonquian tattooing practices, including \u201cpinking, listing, cutting, engraving, and embroidering \u2026 had multiple and ambiguous associations with art, fashion, and writing\u201d (34). At once relatable and inescapably \u201csavage,\u201d tattoos contributed to the immediate \u201cothering\u201d of Native bodies. Still, as Odle convincingly argues, this phase of interactions was remarkable in that Englishmen showed much attention toward gendered aspects of tattooing and displayed a genuine curiosity toward deciphering bodily markings as a language \u201canalogous but not equivalent to their own writing\u201d (15).\n\nChapter 2 then transports the readers to the second half of the eighteenth century to explore the contradictory meanings of cross-cultural tattoos, especially in areas affected by the Seven Years\u2019 War. During this time, tattoos started intersecting more with scalping in that they became more strictly associated with \u201cmartial masculinity\u201d and the infliction of pain as either honorific or punishing. Both English and French colonists continued to attempt to read tattoos as infallible marks of status, military prowess, and identity. Yet, when applied to colonial bodies, the meanings of tattoos appeared increasingly ambiguous and contested, which the author attributes to \u201cconcerns about just how closely cultural identity and bodily integrity might\u2014or might not\u2014be intertwined\u201d (46). Drawing on previous scholarly interpretations and rich textual instances of cross-cultural tattoos, Odle suggests that the increasingly hybrid nature of tattooing was revelatory of a significant shift in power dynamics and the imposition of colonial meanings over Native lives.\n\nTurning her sights toward the nasty business of scalping in the second half of the book, Odle continues her meticulous investigation of the effects of colonial violence and its narrativization. In chapter 3, she establishes a remarkably nuanced timeline of the process by which scalps\u2014that of \u201cenemy Indians\u201d and sometimes Europeans\u2014went from being reluctantly accepted by late seventeenth-century New England authorities as a form of tribute to becoming the foundation of a complex set of legal regulations and administrative processes to manage a growing scalp-hunting and reward system. Just like the eradication of wolves from the region, Odle powerfully argues, \u201cstate-authorized scalp bounties can be understood as one instantiation of a settler-colonial \u2018logic of elimination\u2019\u2014stories that insist on the marginalization and attempted erasure of Native people in order that settlers might access territory\u201d (90). The famous case of Hannah Duston, who was celebrated as a Massachusetts hero for killing and bringing back the scalps of her Abenaki captors (men, women, and children) in 1697, captures the full contradictions of New Englanders\u2019 attitudes toward scalping, which could be condemned as barbaric when targeting whites, while being simultaneously encouraged, financially and socially rewarded, and heralded as legitimate modes of state violence when targeting Natives. The importance and yet ultimate artificiality of colonial storytelling in documenting the acquisition of \u201capproved\u201d scalps becomes clear when one considers the frequency of \u201cfraud,\u201d including grave robbing, and the fact that scalp-hunting raids were also slave-hunting raids (78\u201379).\n\nChapter 4 further demonstrates the power of narrativization in dehumanizing Indigenous people while serving the goals of colonization, by diving into fascinating and surprisingly numerous instances of scalping survivors and the stories they told in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century America. Despite the undeniable involvement of colonists in the collecting of scalps, \u201caccounts by colonial observers portrayed it as a distinctively Indigenous form of violence\u201d (93). Mirroring the diversity of meanings attributed to cross-cultural tattoos, modified settler-colonial bodies that bore the scars of their close encounter with scalping were subject to varying interpretations\u2014\u201cas honorable war wounds, a sign of Providence, a shameful mark of the community\u2019s failure to protect its own, or an uncertain mingling of all of the above\u201d (95). At the border between biology and culture, scalps and scalping wounds offer insights into the increasing racialization of difference (104) and settler-colonial fears of being transformed by their contact with Indigenous others (111).\n\nOdle has written a thought-provoking book that engages with a layered kind of colonial violence, one grounded in the transformation rather than the destruction of bodies, which included physical wounds as well as the metaphorical violence of erasure enacted through the stories colonists built around tattoos and scalps. Because this slim volume mostly focuses on settler-colonial perceptions, reappropriations, and selective narrativization of these two practices, readers will need to look elsewhere for a more comprehensive analysis of the ethnographic origins and meanings of tattooing and scalping for various Eastern North American communities. The volume-rich grounding in theoretical approaches of the subaltern body and the commodification of people through emerging racial thought makes it a very engaging starting point for anyone interested in further investigating the embodied dimensions of colonialism. Accessible prose, excellent illustrations, and fascinating collections of historical anecdotes and characters finish to make it an essential read."
