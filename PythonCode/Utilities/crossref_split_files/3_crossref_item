    "abstract": "<jats:p>By 2050 there could be around 12 billion tons of plastic in landfills and the natural environment, which could be avoided by using a more environmentally friendly alternative: biologically produced plastic, or bioplastic. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a bioplastic whose precursor is an intermediate in the ethylmalonyl\u2010CoA pathway (EMCP), a pathway for acetyl\u2010CoA assimilation in bacteria. The genes that encode the enzymes for two different acetyl\u2010CoA assimilation pathways, the glyoxylate bypass (GB) and the EMCP, have been observed in two PHB\u2010producing bacteria: <jats:italic>Rhodobacter capsulatus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Paracoccus denitrificans</jats:italic>. It was previously observed that <jats:italic>P. denitrificans</jats:italic> asynchronously uses both pathways when grown with acetate. We produced <jats:italic>R. capsulatus</jats:italic> fusion strains by fusing the gene for a fluorescent protein, mCherry, to the gene of a key enzyme of the EMCP or GB and observed the fluorescence during growth with acetate. Tracking fluorescence allowed us to track the accumulation of each key enzyme, which indirectly indicates the activity of the pathway. We observed that unlike <jats:italic>P. denitrificans</jats:italic>, the GB in <jats:italic>R. capsulatus</jats:italic> is not essential to growth with acetate. Understanding the use/occurrence of the EMCP in bacteria is a step to being able to manipulate the EMCP to produce commercially relevant levels of bioplastic and related products.</jats:p>",
