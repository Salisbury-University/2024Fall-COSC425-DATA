AB An experiment is described that allows students to investigate the physical chemistry involved in unimolecular fragmentation and to explain their experimental results using Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel (RRK) theory. For the experiment, students prepare a solution of a series of homologous analytes and collect mass spectra of those analytes using GC-MS. All the analytes undergo the same three-step fragmentation in the mass spectrometer. The relative peak intensities from the ions in the fragmentation scheme are plotted as a function of the vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecular ions' R group. Trends in these plots can be explained using concepts from RRK theory and highlight the "degrees of freedom effect" in mass spectrometry. The experiment is suitable for a variety of upper-level, undergraduate chemistry laboratories.
