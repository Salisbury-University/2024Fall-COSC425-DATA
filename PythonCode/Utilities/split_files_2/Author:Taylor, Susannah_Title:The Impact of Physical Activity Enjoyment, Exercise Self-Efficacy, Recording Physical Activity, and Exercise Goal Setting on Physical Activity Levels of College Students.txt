AB Physical inactivity has been established to be problematic for college students both short- and long-term. Their participation in physical activity (PA) is influenced by many factors which will be explored in this study. The purpose of the study was to examine the interrelationships of PA enjoyment, exercise goal setting, exercise self-efficacy, and recording PA behaviors and the impact on PA. One thousand four hundred and seventy-six students at a public university in the United States responded to a questionnaire consisting of validated survey instruments regarding PA levels and exercise behaviors between 2014 and 2018. Exercise self-efficacy, PA enjoyment and recording PA were direct positive predictors of PA. Our findings reinforce the positive influence between PA enjoyment, exercise self-efficacy, and establishing exercise goals with increased PA. Particularly, exercise goal setting and PA enjoyment not only directly impact PA but also influence other model variables, underscoring their significance in enhancing PA among college students.
