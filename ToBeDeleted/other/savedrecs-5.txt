AB Using data from long jump competitions from IAAF World Championships and Olympics from 2005 to 2017, we find evidence that interim rank is an important determinant of risk-taking and that ranking information can impact risktaking in different ways across gender. An athlete's rank relative to (1) their peers' performances, (2) their own ability, and (3) their peers' abilities all appear to be important in different scenarios.

ID INTEREST-RATES
AB This paper analyzes how risk -averse investment behavior in a liquidity trap can render quantitative easing ineffective under certain circumstances. For risk -averse firms that could lever either a risky investment project or a riskless alternative, I show that the real interest rate responsiveness of a relative net investment return causes both the interest -rate sensitivity of investment and the slope of the aggregate demand (AD) curve to bifurcate. Except for the scenario of sufficiently low investment return and high real interest rates, investment is positively related to real interest rates and the AD curve is downward sloping; under the circumstances, quantitative easing backfires but laissez faire helps stimulate investment instead.

AB Korean immigrant fathers were interviewed and the consensual qualitative research (CQR) method was employed to analyze the data. Five domains (challenges, identity, values, relationship, and well-being) and seventeen categories emerged. Participants experienced implicit discrimination and cultural barriers. They identified themselves as Koreans and valued family's well-being as their priority. They made efforts to find meaning and satisfaction by supporting children to become independent adults. Participants were aware of their traditional parenting styles and the intergenerational cultural gap with their children. As first-generation immigrants, Korean immigrant fathers reported a lack of genuine relationships with both Korean Americans and non-Korean Americans outside of their families. Although participants reported freedom from the pressure caused by interdependent Korean culture, they felt homesickness and emptiness without their own valued life goals.

DE incapacitated; forcible; rape; empathy
AB Rape experience is common and victim empathy may help address it (e.g., prevention, victim support). We examined rape victim empathy based on type of rape experience (none, incapacitated, forcible, combined). Undergraduate women (n = 658) completed the Rape Victim Empathy-During Subscale and Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization. Rape experience was associated with greater empathy, especially for those with any forcible experience. Perhaps due to weaker memory of their own rape event, incapacitated victims may be relatively less able than forcible victims to understand another victim's perspective during a rape. Researchers should consider examining incapacitated and forcible rape as distinct experiences.

ID LIFE-STYLE MEDICINE; PATIENT; MODELS
AB With increasing recognition of the interdependencies of human and planetary health, calls for a socially and environmentally just framework of health have centered on whole person healthcare (WPHC) approaches. This perspective piece proposes an argument for broadening the definition of human health from WPHC to one that is guided by the philosophical orientation of traditional whole system medicine (WSM) approaches, undergirded by the values of social and environmental justice, and supported by the practices of an allopathic-integrative medicine-based WPHC framework. This piece presents opportunities for praxis offered by a WSM-WPHC framework to address global inequity, environmental disparities, and sustainability challenges. An ecological WSM-WPHC framework envisages social and environmental justice in material and discursive ways by foregrounding environmental planetary ecological consciousness as constitutive of human consciousness and biopsychosocial composition. It argues for structural support through formalized programmatic pathways targeting funding opportunities and mechanisms that invite investigations addressing epistemic challenges of expanding definitions of evidence constituting basic science knowledge domains beyond mechanistic, causal, and formative paradigms. Furthermore, it calls for innovative research directions examining the integration and validation of evidence-based approaches incorporating the ontologically diverse and epistemically distinct ontological orientation of WSM and clinical approaches. A WSM-WPHC framework that positions human health within the parameters of social and environmental justice principles envisions the material enactment of the practice of health and medicine as a universal planetary value.

AB Let IG:=IG(2,2n+1) denote the odd symplectic Grassmannian of lines which is a horospherical variety of Picard rank 1. The quantum cohomology ring QH*(IG) has negative structure constants. For n >= 3, we give a positivity condition that implies the quantum cohomology ring QH*(IG) is the only quantum deformation of the cohomology ring H*(IG) up to the scaling of the quantum parameter. This is a modification of a conjecture by Fulton.

AB Ethics is largely dominated by European curriculum which includes Western moral theories such as deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and care ethics. To decenter this dominant ethics curriculum, the present phenomenological study explored the moral lived experience of ethics for Korean Buddhist (male and female) monastics (N = 21). Using three-level qualitative coding, data were thematically analyzed. Findings revealed three overarching themes (1) the importance of the sangha and community care, (2) the presence of ethical tensions, and (3) ethics as a practice. Each theme had two sub-themes. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of how these insights from the lived experience of Buddhist ethics may inform and advance social work ethics education beyond the Eurocentric curriculum.

AB An experiment is described that allows students to investigate the physical chemistry involved in unimolecular fragmentation and to explain their experimental results using Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel (RRK) theory. For the experiment, students prepare a solution of a series of homologous analytes and collect mass spectra of those analytes using GC-MS. All the analytes undergo the same three-step fragmentation in the mass spectrometer. The relative peak intensities from the ions in the fragmentation scheme are plotted as a function of the vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecular ions' R group. Trends in these plots can be explained using concepts from RRK theory and highlight the "degrees of freedom effect" in mass spectrometry. The experiment is suitable for a variety of upper-level, undergraduate chemistry laboratories.

AB In the context of the Great Challenges for Social Work, this conceptual paper envisions a "radical imaginary" as a call to action to incrementally build an epistemically just ethics infrastructure in the coming decade that centers race, ethnicity, and culture. The existing challenges of the dominance of moral absolutes and Eurocentric ethics curriculum were examined. Three change processes were proposed to help build a futuristic infrastructure for ethics praxis with a thicker, more equitable, and more inclusive moral social fabric. This "radical imaginary" promotes anti-racist and anti-oppressive ethics praxis that seeks to eliminate both ethical social isolation and ethics-based racism.

AB Background Temporality is understood as the subjective perception of the flow of chronological time and is a central component of contemporary and integrative medicine approaches. Although temporal dynamics are recognized as central to the processes associated with chronic pain (CP), the temporal management of CP is inadequately understood in pain research.Research question How is temporality conceptualized in Ayurvedic protocols of CP management?.Method Ayurvedic physicians (N = 10) from India were recruited through purposive and snowball sampling. A semi-structured interview protocol was employed to gather qualitative data focusing on the Ayurvedic protocol employed to treat CP patients. The interviews were audio-recorded, professionally transcribed, and thematically analyzed. Member validation, participant voice, and researcher self-awareness were employed to strengthen reliability and validity.Findings An ontologically grounded thematic exploration of Ayurvedic protocols illustrates that temporality is conceptualized in CP as spatiotemporal present moment awareness (PMA) and embodied time (ET). Spatiotemporality as PMA references an awareness of the relationality of cognitive temporal movement, dosha operations, and their pathophysiological expression in the body. Spatiotemporality as ET is conceptualized as awareness of the expression of time in embodied emotional and psychosocial processes as in the movement of the breath through the body, the movement of body sensations over time, and in their intersection with consciousness.Discussion The study findings present an experiential and relational framework situating spatiotemporality ontologically as an organizing principle in CP management. While temporality focuses on the representation of experiences and relations over time, spatiotemporality foregrounds a constructionist approach by centering the embodied spatial cognitive expression of time, consciousness, and subjective experience.

AB This article analyzes Hector Tobar's The Tattooed Soldier as a hemispheric critique of racialization and social dispossession bridging the gap between Central America and the United States. Examining the homeless and the refugee subjects in the novel as structurally equivalent, the article explores the ramifications of internal and external displacements in relation to the protections of citizenship and political asylum. It explores how neoliberal ideologies and practices allow for the creation and naturalization of urban spaces of abjection, effectively condoning the social death of subjects not deemed worthy of respect or social value. In doing so, the article demonstrates how social and spatial dispossession is subsumed into everyday life, becoming naturalized and invisible. It demonstrates how social and political disenfranchisement are constructed discursively and spatially, considering the novel's stories of immigration and asylum-seeking not only as Latina/o/x stories but also as intrinsic parts of the stories that constitute the United States.

TI Preparing New Clinical Educators: 10-Year Outcomes of a Hybrid Program
SO JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID NURSE FACULTY; ISSUES
AB Background: Recruitment and retention of new clinical educators is of urgent concern as it coincides with a growing need for qualified RNs. One solution is to provide intensive training experiences for expert clinicians who can become educators. Method: This mixed-method research reports on 10-year outcomes of one hybrid program and the improvements made to align with best practices in learning in an online environment. Results: From 2012 to 2021, a total of 264 participants completed the program, with 71% taking teaching positions in 21 of 26 Maryland nursing programs. Aggregate data from surveys and focus groups revealed a need for improvements in the organization of program materials, strategies to help participants manage the program's pace, and further efforts to create an ongoing sense of community. Conclusion: In the past 10 years, the Faculty Academy and Mentorship Initiative cians for educator roles while using data to drive change and improve the participant experience

AB This study explores incomplete decision-making dynamics on reward-based crowdfunding platforms, focusing on temporal and social factors influencing backers' decisions. Utilizing the temporal aspect (i.e., pledging campaign phase) and social aspect (i.e., current pledged amount ratio) as stimuli within the stimulus-organism-response framework, our findings reveal that nearly 50.9% of respondents change their initial decisions, highlighting widespread incomplete information processing. Backers are more prone to altering decisions under heightened time pressure and display herding behaviors. Furthermore, backers exhibit an increased likelihood of changing decisions under heightened time pressure, coupled with a greater chance that the pledged goal amount will not be achieved. The study discusses theoretical and practical implications.

   conservation policy impact evaluation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS

ID PROTECTED AREAS
AB A fast-growing literature uses remotely sensed land-cover data along with quasi-experimental statistical methods to assess the efficacy of forest conservation interventions. A critical modeling choice is the spatial unit of analysis-points, grid cells, and polygons are all commonly used. Yet little is known about the implications of this choice for treatment effect estimates and for their interpretation. We demonstrate that point-level data can generate treatment effect estimates substantially different from those based on polygon-level data when (i) a disproportionate share of sample points is drawn from relatively large, treated polygons as a result of random or quasi-random spatial sampling, and (ii) the intervention analyzed has heterogeneous effects that depend on treatment polygon size. Our paper has four parts. First, using real-world data (on the award of timber extraction permits to forest management units in Mexico) that meet the two aforementioned criteria, we demonstrate that point- and polygon-level data generate qualitatively different results, and we propose a simple method for weighting the point-level data to recover the polygon-level results. Second, we conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to clarify the mechanism that causes this phenomenon and to provide reassurance that it is not driven by unobserved confounding factors. Third, we present new evidence (on Mesoamerican and Dominican protected areas) suggesting this phenomenon is not uncommon. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the design and interpretation of spatial evaluations of forest conservation interventions. Although our analysis focuses on point- versus polygon-level data, the mechanism we describe also applies to grid cell- versus polygon-level data.

ID HIGH-SCHOOL; STUDENTS
AB Information literacy is a crucial skill often overlooked by faculty in higher education, who expect incoming Gen Z students to have some ability to navigate the information landscape appropriately and efficiently either from prior high school instruction or simply by the ubiquity of information access. Assessments of college students' information literacy paints a different picture, indicating that information literacy instruction is required and that deliberate efforts should be made to aid students in proper evaluation and use of informational media. This study investigates the value of generalized information literacy instruction at a medium-sized, public 4-year university in a rural area. Student knowledge is assessed pre- and post-instruction to determine specific impacts of information literacy instruction on various facets of information literacy - source quality, relevance, and context. Specifically, the purpose of this research is to determine (1) whether information literacy varies across students in different fields/disciplines and (2) if so, whether generalized information literacy instruction tends to close those cross-disciplinary gaps or extend existing disparities. Data collected herein demonstrate that gains in information literacy vary substantially by academic discipline. For example, students in the College of Humanities and Fine Arts began with the second-highest average pre-instruction scores (75.00 %) and exhibited the largest gains between pre- and post-instruction assessments (+12.14 %). The results obtained in this study indicate that generalized instruction tends to inflate existing disparities in information literacy between disciplines. Based on these findings, there is ample evidence to suggest that discipline-specific information literacy instruction could provide students with larger individual gains and potentially allow information literacy to converge across fields.

AB In this paper, we use the well-documented mutual fund flow-performance relationship to infer information about investors' preferences. We show that applying preference parameter values from experimental settings to market data can significantly understate the role of prospect theory in explaining investor behavior. We find evidence that mutual fund investors exhibit loss aversion and differential attitudes toward risk over losses (risk-seeking) and gains (risk-averse) but no significant probability weighting when evaluating fund performance. Our results apply more strongly to retail funds compared to institutional funds, consistent with the view that prospect theory is more relevant for retail investors. Finally, we show that, for parameter values that best explain fund flows, prospect theory outperforms the global risk aversion framework and widely-used asset pricing models in explaining investors' responses to fund performance.

AB 3D printing is a relatively new digital technology which can transform the way firms organize their innovation and production operations locally and globally. While 3D printing is being adopted by diverse organizations worldwide, empirical academic research on investment in early- stage 3D printing technology firms is still limited. In this paper, we consider the geography of the 3D printing ecosystem to illuminate the financing of investment into early state firms developing innovation in this technology. Using a hand-collected dataset of 500 firm-level investments, we hypothesize 3D printing investment is drawn to countries with greater innovative capacity, countries with greater human capital competencies, and countries with higher wages. We find that larger investments tend to benefit companies developing 3D printing technology in higher wage locations and in countries with higher innovative capacity level, suggesting that investments in the 3D printing ecosystems take places mostly in locations that already have an ecosystem in place. Our study is one of the first to examine detailed patterns of global investment in a new digital technology ecosystem- 3D printing, an increasingly important technology for innovation.

AB Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) students on university campuses experience high rates of sexual violence relative to their cisgender peers and are less likely to utilize campus resources. Despite this, TGD students' voices are often left out of conversations about campus sexual violence. To learn about TGD students' experiences of university sexual violence prevention and response infrastructure, we conducted focus groups with 21 TGD students at a large university in the northeastern United States. Informed by abolition feminism and critical trans politics, we undertook this thematic analysis to examine the limits of current systems to respond to TGD students' needs and reduce their victimization. Our findings highlight how carceral logic contributes to TGD students' exclusion from and distrust of university systems to address sexual violence. Further, our findings illustrate how TGD students' visions for healing-oriented approaches to sexual violence on campuses align with transformative justice principles. These findings suggest that feminist social work must support the development of campus sexual violence prevention and response infrastructure that moves away from a reliance on carceral logic and toward approaches developed by community-led transformative justice organizations to inform inclusive, intersectional, campus sexual violence prevention, and response efforts.

AB Mobile money (MM) enables users, especially the unbanked, to access financial services via mobile phones in developing countries. Whereas much has been studied about the socioeconomic benefits of MM in sub-Saharan Africa, little is known about whether and how MM use influences risk-taking behaviors such as gambling. This paper documents that MM use leads to the heightened probability of gambling and this probability increases with use frequency. Moreover, we find that young male MM users with a lower socioeconomic status (i.e., unemployed, low education, and low income) are more likely to engage in gambling. Our findings call for policymakers' attention to the potential for unintended consequence of MM.

AB This research article employs the continuous wavelet transform analysis to identify the climatological effects among various water quality parameters to identify the successfulness of upland stream restoration on the receiving mesohaline tidal creeks. Estuaries and their corresponding tidal creeks have been impacted by human anthropogenic influences for decades, allowing a variety of restoration practices to be implemented in upland streams. In the face of climate variability and continuous human development pressures, this research performs statistical analysis and a wavelet coherence on, before, and after stream restoration for water quality changes in Chesapeake Bay's tidal tributaries in the Lower Western Shore to identify if the restoration strategies have been effective in the mesohaline tidal creeks. Statistical analysis showed that currently, the receiving tidal basins are not seeing the required positive improvements in water quality after years of upland stream restoration. Compounding this is the fact climate variability cannot be ignored. Results indicate that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has significant wavelet coherence with bottom dissolved oxygen, precipitation, and nutrients. This suggests that current restoration efforts may not be able to keep up with climate variability, and other techniques (restoration or policies) may need to be implemented.

AB The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, has invaded various wetlands such as beaches, swamps, and mangrove forests. We hypothesize that S. invicta can effectively forage food in these habitats. Here, the food searching and transport by S. invicta on each substrate (sand or soil with freshwater or artificial seawater) at different saturation levels (70%, 100%, 130%, or 160%) were evaluated. Ants walked on unsubmerged substrates (70%- and 100% -saturated) to search for food, and surprisingly, they swam and passed 130%- or 160% -saturated substrates that were submerged with thin layers of water. Saturation level may significantly affect duration of food search and/or transport, depending on substrate types. The number of foraging ants rapidly increased and decreased on the food -releasing platform located on the 70% -saturated substrate and remained stable on the platform located on the 100% -saturated substrate. However, only a few ants were found on the platform located on waterlogged substrates throughout the experiment. In addition, no food was successfully transported passing the waterlogged substrate. We also compared food search and transport among four substrates (sand or soil with freshwater or seawater) at the 70%- or 100% -saturation level. Ants spent similar time searching for food and transporting food on the platform, but minimal food was transported passing the soil with freshwater or seawater. Our results showed that S. invicta can successfully search for food but fail to transport food on waterlogged substrates. In addition, both substrate types and saturation level affected food transport under unsubmerged conditions.

AB In this meta-analysis, we examine the relationship between fear and the three facets of work performance, namely task performance, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), and counterproductive work behavior (CWB). We integrated the disparate literature by establishing a unifying theoretical framework informed by the resource-based perspective. Results showed that fear is negatively related to task performance and OCB, and positively related to CWB. In addition, the negative relationship between fear and OCB is stronger for OCBs directed toward the organization (OCB-O) than OCBs directed toward individuals (OCB-I). The positive relationship between fear and CWB is stronger in male dominated samples and countries with high religiosity. Furthermore, stress mediated the effects of fear on task performance, OCB, and CWB. We note the theoretical and practical implications in light of the study findings, and discuss study limitations and future research needs.

AB We study whether the quality of the first job is lower for professional Asian nationals than for non-Asian nationals in the USA. With over a million professionals from Asia entering the US labor market in the past decade, a potential under placement may be both inefficient and discriminatory. We collected data on all newly hired assistant professors of management in research-intensive (R1) universities in the USA between 2010 and 2021. We focus on the quality of the university into which first hires are placed and examine whether first-job placement quality is lower for individuals who were born in East, South and Southeast Asia. We find that the quality and quantity of publication record are positively related to the quality of the placement and that Asian nationals have higher performance. However, Asian nationals are placed at lower-quality universities relative to their peers. Further, Asian nationals require a strong performance signal, in the form of first or second authorship on a publication to narrow the placement gap. Our results are explained by a combination of direct bias against applicants of Asian nationality and a requirement of a higher performance "burden of proof" from these applicants, compared to peers who are non-Asian nationals.

AB Solutions journalism is one of the newest alternative journalism strategies aimed at combating news fatigue through rigorous reporting on solutions to society's problems. One of the primary goals for the movement is increased source diversity that features more non-official and citizen voices, like those often used in other forms of alternative media. This study examined the types of sources journalists included in 555 text-based solutions journalism articles from the U.S., Europe, and Africa collected from the Solutions Journalism Network. The results indicate solutions stories are meeting the goals set forth by proponents of the movement, as they most frequently include nonprofits/groups and unaffiliated citizens. Solutions stories in American publications contained significantly more non-official sources than did their European and African counterparts, though these sources still comprised the majority of those used across all three continents. However, solutions stories included in the study contained fewer total sources than traditional news articles and still featured government and business sources regularly. This finding suggests solutions journalism practitioners may still have work to do to increase their use and variety of sources.

AB Multicultural Feminist Mentoring (MFM) models have provided an important foundation to address the further need for conceptualizing a mentoring model that is specific to Asian/Asian American (A/AA) experiences. In this collaborative autoethnography, six researchers in three mentor-mentee dyads explored what it means to pursue Asian/Asian American feminist mentoring (A/AAFM), through dyadic and group interactive dialogues and collaborative analysis. A/AAFM can be conceptualized as anti-racist praxis, where each mentor attempted to consider mentoring as activism within academia, being grounded in values stemming from A/AA experiences and feminism. Results yielded a model of A/AAFM which emphasizes a convergence of multifaceted racial and cultural identities, feminist values, and activism. Three specific processes emerged: being holistic, relational, and mutual; a focus on community and intergenerational generosity; and intentional flattening of the power hierarchy. Implications for training and activism are discussed.

Data was analyzed, themed, and coded.ResultsA thematic analysis of the descriptions of wellness revealed 2 higher-ordered themes as whole-person and wellbeing, and 3 lower-ordered themes of balance, interconnectedness, and personalized in relation to participants' understanding of wellness.ConclusionsThe importance of balance between wellness dimensions and the acknowledgment of the interconnectedness of wellness dimensions are related to quality of life and life satisfaction. A deeper insight is needed to better understand the perceptions of wellness in this population to provide more effective interventions. This can be achieved through the development of enhanced pedagogy, which may improve student health.

AB This study investigates the effect of environmental and social (E&S) disclosure and managerial entrenchment on investment efficiency. E&S disclosure increases not only capital accessibility but also external monitoring of entrenched managers' actions. We develop a theoretical model that demonstrates how these benefits and costs of firms' voluntary E&S disclosure affect investment efficiency. Using a large sample of U.S.-listed firms over the period 2016-2022, we test the model's predictions and provide empirical evidence suggesting that E&S disclosure is positively associated with investment efficiency and that this effect is stronger for firms with lower managerial entrenchment or those disclosing more financially material E&S information. Our study contributes to the investment efficiency literature by demonstrating the relevance of an incentive-compatible mechanism reflecting managers' choice of E&S voluntary disclosure to the efficient capital allocation.

AB Mathematics serves as a fundamental intelligent theoretic basis for computation, and mathematical analysis is very useful to develop computational methods to solve various problems in science and engineering. Integral transforms such as Laplace Transform have been playing an important role in computational methods. In this paper, we will introduce Sumudu Transform in a new computational approach, in which effective computational methods will be developed and implemented. Such computational methods are straightforward to understand, but powerful to incorporate into computational science to solve different problems automatically. We will provide computational analysis and essentiality by surveying and summarizing some related recent works, with additional automatic proof details by applying system built-in functions. Applications include the computation of coefficients of Taylor's expansions, calculation of generating functions, mathematical identity proofs, solving differential equations and integral equations. For demonstration purposes, some of the methods were implemented in Maple with demonstrational results matching the expected values.

AB Background: Caring for an increasingly older and multicultural patient population requires nurses and APNs who are able to integrate cultural competency in meeting the needs of their patients while decreasing health care disparities. A study -abroad immersion experience is one way to instill deep learning and cultural competency. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to understand the lived experience of baccalaureate nursing students and APN students working together in a study -abroad, service -learning experience. Method: Using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) (Smith & Osborn, 2003), we explored the lived experience of Baccalaureate and Advanced Practice Nursing Students in a service -learning, study -abroad experience in Belize. Results: Emergent themes derived from students ' journal transcripts were: (1) Allowing learning to take place; (2) Practicing nursing with limited resources (3) A different take on culture; and (4) Kinship with peers. From this theme two sub themes emerged: 1) students ' connection with the people and the country, and 2) students ' connection with each other. Conclusion: Cultural immersion prepared students to work in Belize with different patient groups, having varied perspectives related to their health. Students learned that the core values of dignity and caring require that we, as nurses, go where the patient is -not where we want the patient to be. This is tested when students are confronted with a culture not their own.

AB The aim of this study is to determine if extended-release, bioabsorbable, subcutaneous naltrexone (NTX) implants can mitigate respiratory depression after an intravenous injection (IV) of fentanyl. Six different BIOabsorbable Polymeric Implant Naltrexone (BIOPIN) formulations, comprising combinations of Poly-d,l-Lactic Acid (PDLLA) and/or Polycaprolactone (PCL-1 or PCL-2), were used to create subcutaneous implants. Both placebo and naltrexone implants were implanted subcutaneously in male dogs. The active naltrexone implants consisted of two doses, 644 mg and 1288 mg. A challenge with IV fentanyl was performed in 33 male dogs at 97-100 days after implantation. Following the administration of a 30 mu g/kg intravenous fentanyl dose, the placebo cohort manifested a swift and profound respiratory depression with a similar to 50% reduction in their pre-dose respiratory rate (RR). The BIOPIN NTX-implanted dogs were exposed to escalating doses of intravenous fentanyl (30 mu g/kg, 60 mu g/kg, 90 mu g/kg, and 120 mu g/kg). In contrast, the dogs implanted with the BIOPIN naltrexone implants tolerated doses up to 60 mu g/kg without significant respiratory depression (<50%) but had severe respiratory depression with fentanyl doses of 90 mu g/kg and especially at 120 mu g/kg. Bioabsorbable, extended-release BIOPIN naltrexone implants are effective in mitigating fentanyl-induced respiratory depression in male canines at about 3 months after implantation. This technology may also have potential for mitigating fentanyl-induced respiratory depression in humans.

AB Physical inactivity has been established to be problematic for college students both short- and long-term. Their participation in physical activity (PA) is influenced by many factors which will be explored in this study. The purpose of the study was to examine the interrelationships of PA enjoyment, exercise goal setting, exercise self-efficacy, and recording PA behaviors and the impact on PA. One thousand four hundred and seventy-six students at a public university in the United States responded to a questionnaire consisting of validated survey instruments regarding PA levels and exercise behaviors between 2014 and 2018. Exercise self-efficacy, PA enjoyment and recording PA were direct positive predictors of PA. Our findings reinforce the positive influence between PA enjoyment, exercise self-efficacy, and establishing exercise goals with increased PA. Particularly, exercise goal setting and PA enjoyment not only directly impact PA but also influence other model variables, underscoring their significance in enhancing PA among college students.

AB Conversion of primate forest habitat is a global concern with significant implications for primate populations. Although the geospatial Extent of Occurrence (EOO) data provided for primates by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature are widely used, they do not accurately reflect the existing extent of primate species because of ongoing habitat loss. We focused on four capuchin monkey species (Sapajus apella, S. flavius, S, libidinosus, and S. xanthosternos), all native to North and Northeastern Brazil, to prioritize research by the Capuchin Action Network. We refined the EOOs for the four primate species using MapBiomas land cover data. We accounted for areas of agriculture, urban, and mining and updated the EOOs of the four species. Additionally, we evaluated the Conservation Units in each EOO. Conservation Units are protected areas critical to mitigating habitat loss in Brazil. Our results show that S. apella has lost the smallest amount of its EOO (13%), while S. flavius has lost the most (77%). Agriculture was the leading cause of land cover change, followed by urbanization and mining. We provide an updated EOO for the four capuchin species and highlight the need for conservation efforts to address the challenges posed by human activities in the capuchin species' habitats.

AB The use of evidence in bolstering message believability has been shown in the literature. However, more work is needed to understand the effect of evidence in the monetary donation context for nonprofit organizations. This paper aims to partially close the knowledge gap in this area by (i) comparing the effectiveness of statistical and narrative donation messages on message believability, (ii) investigating the moderating effect of abstract and concrete mindset on the relationship between message type and believability, and (iii) analyzing the resulting effect on subsequent donation intentions. Our findings show that there is no difference in the effect of statistical versus narrative messages on message believability when the recipient of the message is in abstract mindset. However, when the recipient is in concrete mindset, statistical messages lead to stronger believability perceptions. Furthermore, higher believability is found to increase individual monetary donation intentions.

AB Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic placed extreme burden on hospitals, while opioid overdose is another challenging public health issue. This study aimed to examine the trends and outcomes of opioid overdose hospitalizations in Pennsylvania during 2018 to 2021. Design: We identified opioid overdose hospitalizations in the state of Pennsylvania using the state-wide hospital discharge database (PHC4) 2018 to 2021. We examined the number of opioid overdose hospitalizations, the corresponding mortality and discharges against medical advice comparing the pre-COVID period (2018-2019) and the COVID period (2020-2021). We also assessed what patient and hospital characteristics were associated with in-hospital death or leaving against medical advice. Results: A total of 13 446 opioid-related hospitalizations were identified in 2018 to 2021. Compared to pre-pandemic, a higher percentage of cases involving synthetics (17.0%vs 10.3%, P < .0001) were observed during COVID. After controlling for covariates, there was no significant difference in opioid overdose in-hospital deaths in the years 2020 to 2021 compared to 2018 to 2019 (OR = 0.846, 95% CI: 0.71-1.01, P = .065). The COVID period was significantly associated with more leaving against medical advice compared to years 2018 to 2019 (OR = 1.265, 95% CI: 1.11-1.44, P = .0003). Compared to commercial insurance, Medicaid insurance was associated with higher odds of both in-hospital death (OR = 1.383, 95% CI: 1.06-1.81, P = .0176) and leaving against medical advice (OR = 1.903, 95% CI: 1.56-2.33, P < .0001). Conclusion: There were no substantial changes in the number of overall opioid overdose cases and deaths at hospitals following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania. This observation suggests that an increased number of patients may have succumbed to overdoses outside of hospital settings, possibly due to a higher severity of overdoses. Further, we found that patients were more likely to leave against medical advice during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB Vasopressin and oxytocin are well known and evolutionarily ancient modulators of social behavior. The distribution and relative densities of vasopressin and oxytocin receptors are known to modulate the sensitivity to these signaling molecules. Comparative work is needed to determine which neural networks have been conserved and modified over evolutionary time, and which social behaviors are commonly modulated by nonapeptide signaling. To this end, we used receptor autoradiography to determine the distribution of vasopressin 1a and oxytocin receptors in the Southern giant pouched rat (Cricetomys ansorgei) brain, and to assess the relative densities of these receptors in specific brain regions. We then compared the relative receptor pattern to 23 other species of rodents using a multivariate ANOVA. Pouched rat receptor patterns were strikingly similar to hamsters and voles overall, despite the variation in social organization among species. Uniquely, the pouched rat had dense vasopressin 1a receptor binding in the caudate-putamen (i.e., striatum), an area that might impact affiliative behavior in this species. In contrast, the pouched rat had relatively little oxytocin receptor binding in much of the anterior forebrain. Notably, however, oxytocin receptor binding demonstrated extremely dense binding in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which is associated with the modulation of several social behaviors and a central hub of the social decision-making network. Examination of the nonapeptide system has the potential to reveal insights into species-specific behaviors and general themes in the modulation of social behavior.

TI Bill shape reflects divergent prey consumption for island compared to

AB Feeding morphology permits animals to adapt to changing environments and is often under strong selection. We evaluated if bill shape varies according to differences in dietary prey taken across geographical ranges (North America, Central America, South America, and Caribbean islands) in a ubiquitous, New World raptor species, the American kestrel (Falco sparverius). Specifically, we predicted that bills in geographies where kestrels consumed a larger proportion of vertebrates would be shorter and wider, with a larger tomial tooth. We reviewed the literature on kestrel diets across their range and quantified potential differences in bill shape using geometric morphometric methods for 245 museum specimens. The literature review revealed that most prey consumed by kestrels in North, South, and Central America were invertebrates (51.6-69.1%), whereas Caribbean kestrels consumed mostly vertebrates (61.4%), most of which were reptiles (77.3%). Morphometric analyses agreed with these findings; bill shape differed for island versus mainland kestrels but not among mainland regions. Bill shape on islands reflected a more robust bill with a larger tomial tooth, but had a longer hook, which we suggest is adaptive for consumption of lizard prey, more available on islands due to reduced competition with other raptors compared to mainland regions.

AB Assessing adolescent sexual identity is complicated, and contemporary sexual identities are gaining greater complexity and variation. However, current measures do not capture the diversity of contemporary identities among adolescents. Thus, our study utilized a large national data set of sexual minority adolescents aged 14-17 years (N = 2,558) in the United States to propose a taxonomy of sexual identities among adolescents. Participants responded to a close-ended sexual identity question, followed by an open-ended qualitative question. Using the steps outlined in content analysis procedures, two researchers independently coded the open-ended responses, which were then discussed to establish consensus. Coding of open-ended responses to the sexual identity question resulted in eight categories, with more than 25% of adolescents identifying with less common sexual identity labels. We further tested differences in sexual identity among responses to the close-ended question, sociodemographic characteristics, and mental health outcomes using chi-square and analysis of variance tests. We found overall differences in sexual identification by close-ended responses, age, and assigned sex at birth. However, we did not find any difference in sexual identity by race and ethnicity or urbanicity. We also found differences in sexual identity by mental health symptoms and suicidal outcomes, especially among respondents who identified with less common sexual identity labels. Findings from our study provide cutting-edge information on sexual identities that better captures the current state of adolescent sexual identity classification in the United States. Future research should employ this taxonomy of eight sexual identity categories to collect data that reflect contemporary evidence. Public Significance Statement Findings of this study of the diverse sexual identities among adolescents suggest that, compared to adolescents reporting more common identities (e.g., gay, lesbian, bisexual), those reporting less common sexual identities (e.g., pansexual, queer) are at greater risk for negative mental health outcomes. Further, because these less common sexual identities are often not captured using current measures, the authors propose a more diverse categorical list of eight sexual identities that could be used by researchers to collect this important demographic information in future studies.

AB Ocean warming and acidification may significantly alter the distribution and intensity of harmful algal blooms as well as their effects on marine food webs. Estimating such effects rely, in part, on understanding the physiological response of individual algal species to controlled laboratory simulations of climate change conditions. Here we report the physiological response of the harmful dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum to the combined effects of elevated temperature and CO2 (29 degrees C/1000 ppm CO2). We first examined these effects by comparing ambient control (25 degrees C/441 ppm CO2) and elevated conditions under short-term (similar to 20 generations) growth. Next, we compared the short-term elevated condition to a longer-term (similar to 200 generations) growth scenario under the same elevated temperature and CO2. Under the short-term elevated conditions, K. veneficum growth declined, cell toxicity increased, and saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acid (FA) composition varied significantly from ambient conditions. Meanwhile, after similar to 200 generations of growth under elevated temperature and CO2, K. veneficum carbon assimilation, growth, and cell toxicity were significantly higher than the short-term elevated treatment. Further, while total saturated FA declined, essential fatty acids increased and likely represented an adaptive temporal response to long-term exposure to high temperature and CO2. Such shifts in FA profiles and cell toxicity may possibly alter K. veneficum nutritional quality as prey and its mixotrophic behavior, thereby affecting the energy and mass transfer through the marine food webs as well as bloom dynamics.

AB While nest usurpation and subsequent incubation of eggs and even brooding of chicks from other species has been reported for Common Terns (Sterna hirundo), such behavior is considered rare. We report an observation of a Common Tern pair usurping the Least Tern (Sternula antillarum) nest and brooding the Least Tern chicks. While the Least Tern pair attempted to provide care for the chicks, the Common Terns displayed aggressive behavior and defended the nest. Though both species attempted to feed the chicks, no feeding events were observed due to harassment from the other species. Neither pair was observed nesting prior to or following this event, and all chicks are believed to have been lost to predation. We discuss the possible scenarios leading to the observed usurpation event, the possibility that usurpations are more common than previously believed, and the need for different monitoring methods to elucidate the causes of usurpations.

ID PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY GUIDELINES
AB Background: Bicycling is a healthy form of physical activity that can be performed by most adults as part of leisure-time (LT) activity. However, little is known about LT bicycling behaviors, especially in the rural areas of the United States. This study sought to contrast the prevalence and factors associated with LT bicycling in populations living in urban settings with those living in rural settings. Methods: The 2019 Behavior Risk Factor Survey, which contains information regarding LT physical activity behaviors among adults (N = 396,261) in the United States, was used to determine the prevalence, demographic profile, and likelihood of meeting the physical activity guidelines of LT bicyclists. The 2013 National Center for Health Statistics Urban/ Rural Classification Scheme was used to classify respondents living in rural and urban settings. Results: Among US adults, 3.8% (95% CI, 3.7-3.9) reported LT bicycling activity, the sixth most common physical activity. Adults living in urban counties compared with rural counties had a greater prevalence of LT bicycling (3.9% vs 2.3%, respectively), with adults living in rural counties having a 34% lower probability of LT bicycling. Rural bicycling prevalence rates were lower across all demographics. Urban bicyclists, compared with rural bicyclists, cycled more months of the year. Overall, 85.5% of all bicyclists met the aerobic physical guidelines, with no differences between urban and rural bicyclists. Conclusions: Bicycling remains an important LT physical activity among adults in the United States. However, a rural-urban difference in the prevalence does exist for LT bicycling. The reasons for this disparity warrant further investigation.

AB A survey completed by 22 literacy clinic directors indicated that clinics share beliefs and instructional practices. Literacy clinics provide a context in which children are taught to read and write by clinicians who are training to be literacy teachers. As best practices in reading instruction are debated, effective clinical assessment and instructional practices have endured. Using a student-centered approach, literacy clinics help students become engaged, confident, and capable readers. Research results identified four themes: multiple literacy components, affective factors, a cyclical assessment and instruction process, and clinician and student agency. The article connects these themes and gives examples of the application of the themes for classroom instruction and assessment practices.

TI Nonstandard Errors

DT Article
ID CROSS-SECTION; ANALYSTS; RISK
AB In statistics, samples are drawn from a population in a data-generating process (DGP). Standard errors measure the uncertainty in estimates of population parameters. In science, evidence is generated to test hypotheses in an evidence-generating process (EGP). We claim that EGP variation across researchers adds uncertainty-nonstandard errors (NSEs). We study NSEs by letting 164 teams test the same hypotheses on the same data. NSEs turn out to be sizable, but smaller for more reproducible or higher rated research. Adding peer-review stages reduces NSEs. We further find that this type of uncertainty is underestimated by participants.
