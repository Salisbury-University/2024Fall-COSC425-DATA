The polemical qualities of his conversation are analyzed in examples drawn from the biographical. The bulk of the chapter consists of close analysis of his Parliamentary Debates, which are seen in dialogue with other aspects of print and manuscript culture, and argues that the printed form of these debates may be best described as \u201cconcatenated polemic.\u201d The conclusion turns to further examples drawn from Johnson\u2019s late political writing as well as his literary criticism. In sum, Johnson arrives at some of his most significant insights in the heat of controversy, frequently engaging in dialogue with other texts that is deliberately aggressive and unsparing.</jats:p>",
