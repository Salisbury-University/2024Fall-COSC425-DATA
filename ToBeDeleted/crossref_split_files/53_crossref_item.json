    "abstract": "<jats:p>L\u2010Ascorbate (Vitamin C) is present in the environment in plant tissues, typically at concentrations from 1\u201310mM, and as high as 300mM. L\u2010Ascorbate is also an essential radical scavenger (antioxidant) for plants and mammals and is not synthesized by bacteria. Given the ubiquity of L\u2010ascorbate in the environment, metabolism of L\u2010ascorbate necessarily contributes to ecological recycling. <jats:italic>Ralstonia eutropha</jats:italic> H16, a soil bacterium commonly studied for its versatile use of organic and inorganic carbon sources, can use L\u2010ascorbate as a carbon source via an unknown pathway. Using RNAseq, whole cell transcript levels in <jats:italic>R. eutropha</jats:italic> were compared between L\u2010ascorbate\u2010grown cells and succinate\u2010or fructose\u2010grown cells (controls). Putative pathway genes were identified by their increase in expression greater than 50\u2010fold in <jats:italic>R. eutropha</jats:italic> grown with L\u2010ascorbate. Mutant strains (lacking putative pathway genes) were generated by homologous recombination directed allelic exchange. Wild type and mutant strains were grown in liquid cultures with either L\u2010ascorbate or succinate as their sole carbon source and monitored by optical density to observe the phenotypic result of gene deletion. Growth studies have been performed, and L\u2010ascorbate no growth phenotype has been confirmed for three mutant strains. Collaborators have characterized putative pathway enzymes. Characterizing the proposed catabolic pathway of L\u2010ascorbate in <jats:italic>R. eutropha</jats:italic> will provide information regarding environmental nutrient cycling and contribute novel functions of suspected pathway enzymes to protein databases.</jats:p><jats:p>This abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2019 Meeting.
