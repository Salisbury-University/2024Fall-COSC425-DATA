In the present study, the behavioral responses of <jats:italic>S. invicta </jats:italic>workers to surfaces treated with insecticides were investigated. Toxicological tests showed that beta-cypermethrin had the highest contact toxicity (with the lowest LC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> value) among nine tested insecticides, followed by thiamethoxam, fipronil, indoxacarb, chlorfenapyr, rotenone, spinetoram, avermectin, and chlorantraniliprole. In the laboratory, surfaces treated beta-cypermethrin or rotenone significantly reduced the number of foraging ants. In addition, <jats:italic>S. invicta </jats:italic>workers transported significantly more particles (measured in weight and/or covered area) onto surfaces treated with fipronil (50, 500, and 5000 ppm), rotenone (5000 ppm), or avermectin (5000 ppm) compared with the controls. Similarly, these insecticides significantly triggered the particle-covering behavior of ants in the field. We hypothesized that such behaviors would reduce the contact toxicity of insecticides against <jats:italic>S. invicta. </jats:italic>When the surfaces treated with fipronil or rotenone (500 or 5000 ppm) were artificiality covered with particles, <jats:italic>S. invicta </jats:italic>had significantly higher LT<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> values compared with insecticide-treated surfaces without particles<jats:italic>.</jats:italic> This study provides the first evidence that <jats:italic>S. invicta </jats:italic>workers can perform particle-covering behavior to reduce the toxicity of certain insecticides, which constitutes a unique insecticide-resistance strategy in ants.</jats:p>",
