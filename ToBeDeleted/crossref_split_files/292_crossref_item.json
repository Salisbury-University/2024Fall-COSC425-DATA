    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Between Images proposes a unique theory of montage as a technique of relation: a means of fundamentally rethinking and reshaping how humans relate\u2014to ourselves and each other, to the material world, to the planet and its nonhuman inhabitants. Historically, film criticism has cast montage in one of several roles: as narrative\u2019s invisible executor of spatiotemporal continuity to maintain the viewer\u2019s investment in the story-world; as an agent of disorder that confounds conventions of storytelling and realism and prompts the viewer\u2019s intellectual engagement; and as an expressionistic device for augmenting the duration and combination of shots to affect viewers at a sensory level. While not exactly abandoning such accounts, this study tries to move closer to the heart of montage by distinguishing the space between images as itself a powerful source of ideas, feelings, and forms. Venturing into an \u201cexpanded field of montage\u201d beyond the limited purview of a given film\u2019s \u201cediting,\u201d Between Images traces the cut and the splice across photographic and cinematic media in a range of material, conceptual, and political contexts. In all of this, the space between images becomes a setting for navigating and renegotiating the terms of relation, of the \u201cbeing-with\u201d that connects all forms of life. Between Images brings together a diverse cast of experimental filmmakers, including Harun Farocki, Hito Steyerl, Steve McQueen, Cauleen Smith, Da\u00efchi Saito, and Ja\u2019Tovia Gary, and in doing so, situates the cinematic cut within an interdisciplinary conversation about the abiding capacity of cinema to effect change.</jats:p>",
